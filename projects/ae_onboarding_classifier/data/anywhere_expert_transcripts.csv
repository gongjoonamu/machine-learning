"Hi there! My name is Zack and I’ll be happy to help you with this. 

First, go to the contacts app (Phone —> Contacts) and select the person’s name you’d like to change to a different ring tone. Next, select the details icon (it should look like circled “i”) and press “edit” in the top right corner of the details page. Now, scroll down until you see “Ringtone and Vibration.” You should then be able to set a ringtone for that contact. Make sure to hit “save” before closing the app! 

Did this answer your question? Please let me know if I can help with anything else! ","Hi Jamie! My name is Zack, and I’d be glad to help you with this. 

This first thing to try is a hard rest (don’t worry, it won’t erase any data) - press and hold the sleep/wake button (button on the right side of the phone) and the volume down button at the same time for at least ten seconds. You’ll know it worked if the Apple logo appears on the screen. 

Please let me know if that worked for you - if it doesn’t, I’ve still got a few tricks we can try out!","Hi Timothy! Thanks for reaching out. I’m Zack, and I’ll be happy to get this set up for you. 

First, open up the settings app on your iphone (the gray gear logo). Scroll down a few sections until you see “Accounts & 1words” - it will be before Mail settings, and after the Wallet & Apple Pay settings. 

Next, look for the “Add Account” option. Touch there and you’ll see a screen with a bunch of names of mail accounts (iCloud, Exchange, etc.). Near the bottom, touch “Outlook.com”. 

Follow the prompts on screen to enter your username and 1word from Outlook.com. If it asks for permission to use it, select “Yes.” You’ll then reach the account settings page where you can select what apps to sync with Outlook. Make sure to select “Mail”, and feel free to turn anything else on that you’d like to sync (notes, contacts, calendars, reminders). Touch “Save” at the top right to save your settings. 

That should be it! If you get an error, let me know what it says. Otherwise, open up the mail app and you should start to see mail populating after a few minutes when it gets the chance to sync up. 

Did this work for getting your Outlook account up and running? Let me know if I can be of further assistance. ","Hi there! As an Anywhere Expert, I expect to help people with their tech problems, or simply answer questions about technology. I’m a self-proclaimed tech nerd (both by choice and by occupation), and I’d love a chance to help people reach the ponential their devices can offer them. Oh, and through helping others, I fully expect to learn a lot more about tech that I may be less familiar with. 

As the Technology Director at my company, I work with a lot of different systems to help my company’s employees get the most out of their technology platforms. Why not apply this to people’s day-to-day use of personal tech? I have a 1ion for technology, and I love helping others understand what their devices can do for them.

This is an incredibly interesting business model for crowdsourcing tech support, and I’d love to be a part of it. Not to mention, I think about tech just as much during my free time as I do at work.

Are you around a computer?

Great!!
Sometimes your best bet is restoring your iPhone to its factory settings. This erases all the data and settings on your phone and can solve a lot of problems. Normally, you'd sync your iPhone and restore using iTunes, but if your iPhone won't turn on, try this:

Plug in the iPhone's USB cable to the Lightning/Dock Connector port, but not into your computer.
Hold down the iPhone's Home button (on an iPhone 7, hold volume down).
While holding the Home button, plug the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
This will open iTunes, put the iPhone into recovery mode, and let you completely restore the iPhone.

"Hi my name is Julie and I'll be your expert today! I understand the need to be able to set a specific ringtone for each contact on your Samsung Galaxy S8 phone and I can definitely help you with that. That would make it so much easier to identify each caller without having to look at the phone! Let's get started shall we? Find and open the phone app on your phone. It's on your phone's home screen, and has a phone icon. 
Go to the contact list.
On the contacts list select to find the contact that you want to set a specific ringtone for.
Tap on the contact and select options which will lead you to the “Edit” button.
Scroll down to select the ringtone and click the defaults where you will be redirected to three available options:
Default- That is if you want to use the phones sounds,
Ringtone if you want to set from the pre-loaded ringtones,
or go to my files where you can choose from the songs and music that you have saved in the Galaxy S8+ Plus.
After all that is done, tap “Ok” and then press “Home button” to return to the home screen. Now have the person call you to test and make sure you like the ringtone you've selected. Yes? Awesome! Now that you have the ringtone set and have instructions so you can do this for other contacts, have I resolved all your concerns today? Great! Again my name is Julie and I wanted to thank you for reaching out to us today. Have a great day!","Hi my name is Julie and I'll be your expert today! I understand that having your iPhone 7 power off during charging can be stressful but don't worry, I am here to help you. Your iPhone will power off if the battery gets too low. That is normal so don't stress. The best way to charge your iPhone 7 is by using the charging cable that came with your phone. It is specifically designed for your device.  First, go ahead and unplug the phone from the charger. Let's try a forced reboot of your phone. To do this, hold down the Power and Home buttons at the same time until the Apple logo appears. 
The hard reboot solution works if the iOS has crashed or is frozen, which can sometimes show as an unresponsive iPhone with a black screen that appears dead. Don't worry, your iPhone should power back on at this point. 
Once it powers back on, let's check a few things to make sure your phone is charging properly and you can see the status. If you're plugging the Apple charger into a wall outlet or power strip, make sure it's plugged in all the way. Next plug the charger into the iPhone and look at the battery icon (top right on the phone) for a lightning bolt. That means we are getting power. 
Next go to your settings icon (looks like a gear) and tap Settings, scroll down and tap Battery.
Turn on the battery percentage icon (turns green when on) and you will notice now you can see the percent level of battery charge next to the battery icon on your iPhone. 
Below that there is a wealth of information showing the proportion of battery used by each application. 
To exit, tap your home button and let the iPhone finish charging.
So now, your iPhone is charging, you can see the percentage icon and the lightning bolt on top, and you're on your way to a full charge! Now that you have the information that will help you keep your iPhone charged, have I resolved all your concerns today? Great! Again my name is Julie and I wanted to thank you for reaching out to us today. Have a great day!
","Hi my name is Julie and I'll be your expert today! I can understand adding an email account to your iPhone can be stressful sometimes but have no fear, I can walk you thru adding your Outlook.com account step by step. FIrst, you can check to iOS version you have by tapping on your Settings icon, then General, then About. About midway down you should see ""version"" and next to that you will see your current software version. If you are not currently at version 11, we can still assist, but i would suggest afterwards updating to the latest version by going to Settings, then General, Software Updates. Make sure you are on WiFi when doing this or it won't update. 
Let's get back to your email account shall we? From Settings, go to Accounts & 1words, then Add Account (at the bottom of the page), then choose Outlook.com. 
Enter your email address and tap next.
Enter your 1word and tap Sign In.
Your phone will ask you for permission to sync your mail, calendar, contacts so tap Yes.
You will then have the ability to turn on or off what you wish to sync (Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes. Green means it's on and will sync). Tap Save to continue.
Now tap the Home button and go back to the main screen, look for your mail icon and open it. There it is! Tapping on the Outlook mailbox will bring you to your inbox and mail should start pouring in. Let's test it ok? On the bottom right of the screen, you will see a small square with a pencil shape in it. That's for composing a new message. Go ahead and enter YOUR Outlook.com address in the to: field, write test in the subject and body of the message, the tap SEND. You should soon see an email from you to you, confirming you have added your account successfully and can send and receive! Now that you have the information that will help you add other accounts to your iPhone, have I resolved all your concerns today? Great! Again my name is Julie and I wanted to thank you for reaching out to us today. Have a great day!

At the top of the screen, there should be an ""Edit"" button. Do you see it, Reggie?

Perfect! Go ahead and tap on ""Edit"", which will open the contact editor. At the bottom of that page, it should say ""View More"" - tap on that for me.

Scroll to the very bottom of this page - do you see an option called ""Ringtone""?

Excellent! Tapping on that will open your list of ringtones - you can now select the ringtone you like for your contact. (Repeating this process will allow you to customize the ringtone for each of your contacts!)

When done, you can just exit the app by opening your app drawer and swiping the contacts app left or right to close it.

Did that make sense Reggie? Cool.

I bet you're gonna give all your contacts some neat ringtones! Was I able to resolve your issue today?

Nice. Besides changing your contacts' ringtones, was there anything else I could help out with today?

Hey, no problem! I was happy to be able to help out today. As an Anywhere Expert, I appreciate you hopping on chat with me today! Have a great day, Reggie.

Robert","Hi Jamie! Thanks for connecting with me through Anywhere Expert! My name is Robert and I'm happy to help you figure out why your screen shut off while your iPhone was charging. 

It's super frustrating that your phone is giving you a hard time! Let's see how I can help. May I ask you a few quick questions, Jamie?

Perfect. First question:

With the iPhone still plugged in, try holding down the power key for 15 seconds. Do you see anything at all? Usually, a battery indicator will come up letting you know the phone is drained and just needs some more juice.

Okay - so you see the battery indicator, but your phone still won't turn on, is that right Jamie? Gotcha - okay, quick question:

Are you using the charger that came with your iPhone 7 originally?

Okay great. Sometimes, third party chargers may not charge iPhones as quickly so I always like to rule out that possibility.

Next question:

Just to be sure - was the battery nearly dead on the device when you plugged it in?

Okay - so your battery was at 1% when you plugged it in. It might just need a few minutes to give it some juice :) but let's rule out a few other possibilities.

Have you tried plugging the charger into another outlet? I know sometimes the outlets at my place get a little finicky.

Okay, you're now plugged in to a different outlet. Gotcha. Let's let your iPhone charge for a few minutes. I'll be right here with ya :)

Jamie - it's been a few minutes - how we lookin'? Let's try to boot up your phone now. Usually, iphones will automatically boot up after they've received enough power, but we can try to manually turn on your phone with the power key. Go ahead and hold down that button (the little one on top the phone)

So your device has booted up? Sweet! I'm so glad I was able to help get your device turned back on for you - was there anything else I could help out with today on your iPhone 7?

No problem! It was my pleasure to assist you today, Jamie. I appreciate you taking time out of your day today to chat with me through Anywhere Expert - I hope you have a lovely day (and enjoy using your phone!)

Robert","Hey Timothy! My name is Rob and I'd be happy to help get your Outlook email onto your new iPhone!

By the way, what type of iPhone is that? Is it an X....an 8...? There are so many different types of iPhones out there!

Okay, so you have an iPhone 8. Nice! Congrats on the new phone Timothy. Those phones are pretty sweet. Let's get that email on there so you can get back to your Inbox.

Are you familiar with iPhones? Have you had one before?

Okay perfect - you had an iPhone 7 before your new iPhone 8. Luckily, those phones are extremely similar and adding your Outlook email should be a snap.

Go ahead and unlock your phone and tap on the settings app (the app that looks like a gray circular cog or gear). Let me know once your settings app has opened.

Cool - thanks Timothy. Scroll down for me until you see ""Accounts and 1words"", then tap on that.

You'll now be on a screen that will say ""Add Account"" toward the bottom - do you see that?

Perfect :) Once you've tapped on Add Account, there will be an option at the bottom that says ""Outlook.com"" - go ahead and tap on that for me.

Outlook.com will require your email and 1word - go ahead and enter those in the spaces provided. (The new iOs may ask for your permission to sync mail - you can choose ""Yes"" to give your phone permission).

Give it a few seconds - your account may take a few to sync up with your new iPhone. Once the account syncs in, the next screen you should see will show Mail...Contacts....Calendars...etc. Do you see that screen Timothy?

Excellent. Your account is all synced! Just go ahead and select what features you would like to sync with your iphone (of course Mail, but you can also choose Calendars if you'd like your Outlook calendar to sync up with your phone's!) 

Once done, don't forget to hit ""Save"" in the top right corner of the screen. You can now open your Mail app (little blue and white app with an envelope on it) and you should see your emails.

Hey Tim - do me a favor; when open that app, do you see your emails synced? Awesome! Looks like your Outlook.com email is now synced to your new iPhone.

I was stoked to be able to help get your email setup - was there anything else I could help out with today, Timothy?

No worries! I appreciate your time. Thanks for choosing Anywhere Expert - have a great weekend!

Robert","As an Anywhere Expert, I intend upon providing World-Class service to all who I interact with and provide technical service to. I know that I'll be responsible for not only being polite, courteous, and down-to-Earth but also answering technical questions in a prompt, patient, and confident manner. I relish the opportunity to be able to interact with and help guide customers toward solutions for the problems they face on their mobile phones while maintaining the highest of professional standards and attitude.

One of my 1ions (and therefore hobbies) is to be on the ""up-and-up"" of the technological universe - whether that be reading about innovations in Wired magazine, keeping up with Ted talks about changing the world, following Facebook sources that highlight the growing impacts of AI, or simply reading about the activity in the cell phone industry by platform leaders like Apple and Samsung. 

Considering Anywhere Experts is in Beta, and runs on mobile technology, I feel it would be a delight to help pioneer the platform and help identify opportunities for growth while simultaneously helping people. This kind of stuff invigorates me.  A little bit of my background might provide further clarity just as to why:

- I currently serve as the Chief Technical Officer of a Medium-sized staffing firm based out of Tampa, FL; I handle everything from mail servers, websites, and logo development to SaaS Management/Project Management, and company infrastructure. In short, you could say that I'm our Lead Problem Solver; no matter what problem is presented, I always come up with a solution.

- I'm a ""techie"". I'm the guy that loves bringing in the coolest new tech to the office. Whether its an interesting solution to a problem we have in our business (like GPS watches to help track our Car Rental Transportation fleet to minimize car theft and improve transaction rates) or just a fun little gizmo or gadget (such as Flic Bluetooth buttons that I rigged to control the office lights in our suite), I'm ""that guy"". And I love being him!

- I'm a helper (and a do-er). Since I was 10, my life has been spent volunteering in some capacity. At age 12, I became President of a youth group focused on community service and volunteerism in our community. At age 14, I was nominated an Anne Frank Humanitarian for service to our youth. At age 17, I was elected Class President at my high school and helped guide our school's volunteer programs to assist students with earning scholarships to top colleges across the US. Nearly 10 years later and I personally have nearly 3,000 community service hours. So I don't just help; I do.

Lastly, I'm curious. I'm curious to see if a ""crowd-sourced"" community of everyday folk that are a little ""techie"" can take off. Can a community of smartphone-wielding, solutions-focused individuals, pioneer a new method of tech support? A real-time, mobile, expert connection. An ""Anywhere Expert"".

Perhaps this platform could even transcend cell phone support; into new, uncharted realms. Imagine getting real-time support on a popular PC or console game, or from a mechanic about an issue your car is having? What if this platform evolves into the first ""Social Solutions Network""?

That's why I'm interested in becoming an Anywhere Expert - to see where you guys are going with the platform while simultaneously using my skills in the tech field to help people out.


Thank you for your consideration. Regardless of your decision, I'll follow your platform closely to see where it heads.

First, just to make sure we are following the right steps let's see what OS you are using. If you open your Settings app (the one that looks like the grey gears) and then scroll down to General you will see an About section. In the About screen you will see a Version section that will display the current version of you OS. 

Good, now that we know we are on iOS 11 we can go ahead and get your Outlook account added. If you are still on the About screen go ahead and click back to get to the main Settings screen, or if you closed the Settings app just go ahead and re-open the app. Scroll down until you see the Accounts and 1words option and tap on that. In the next screen there is a section for all of the Accounts linked to your device and clicking on Add Account will bring up the steps for adding an e-mail account to your device. There should be a Outlook.com option towards the bottom of the list that will bring up the Microsoft Sign in page for you to link your account to your device. Once you've entered your username and 1word you will be asked to give the device your permission to access and sync your mailbox, contacts and other information from your Outlook account. Tapping Yes will finish up the process and bring up a settings screen where you can use the toggle switches to control what information from your Outlook account is shared/synced with this device.

I started my IT career almost 10 years ago as a Tech Support Engineer for a financial company and pretty much spent 8 hours a day walking users through using a web application, hooking up a printer and even syncing their work accounts to their mobile devices. I've always been the type of person that likes helping people get the best, and most, use out of their devices so I've been the go to tech guy for my family for years. I recently relocated my family to Arizona from California due to house pricing and I've been wanting to get back into the Tech Support field so I can earn some extra income. I currently work as a freelance application developer, primarily specializing in mobile applications, but in-between contracts or during the slower times of the month it would be nice to have a remote job that I can do to keep me busy and my mind fresh.

OK, let's get this done for you.Do you already know which contact you would like to set up the ringtone for?

Great! On your phone, let's go ahead and jump into the Contact list. 

Good! Now, on the contacts list select to find the specific contact you want to set the ringtone for. 

Excellent! Tap on the contact and select ""Options"" which will lead you to the ""Edit"" button. 

Perfect! Scroll down and select the ringtone. Click the defaults where you will be able to choose 3 options; default (which are the phone sounds), ringtone (from pre-loaded ringtones) or your files (to choose songs and music that you have saved on the phone). 

Awesome! After all that is done, tap on ""OK"" and then press the home button to return to your home screen! 

OK, in the future, repeat these steps to change the ringtone for any other contact!

","Hi! I'm Brandon, and I can absolutely help with that. I have an iPhone 7 too! 

Cool! Let's get this fixed for you. Do you know if your phone has recently suffered from physical or liquid damage?

OK! So, if it isn't broken then this might be a simple system crash. Let's press and hold the volume down button and the power button together from 15-25 seconds. 

Great! If there is enough battery power at this point, the Apple logo will appear. When this happens, release both keys and wait until the device reboots completely. 

Oh no! That's not good. So, if that doesn't work I'm going to have to ask you to make a quick little inspection. Plugging the charger in will charge your phone but the other thing I want to know is whether your iPhone responds when it detects current flows through the circuits. If it remains unresponsive while plugged in, there is a chance the battery or some of its components are damaged. It can also just be a charging issue. 

Here's what you need to do next: check the cable for breakage, look into the port on your charger for lint, debris or corrosion that may prevent charging, try to check the pins to see if one of them is bent, check the charging port of your phone for debris, and/or try using a different charger. 

Awesome! It's nice that you have another cable handy. Try using that cable. 

Perfect! We finally got it to work! Now try powering it on by pressing and holding on the power button!

You're welcome. Thanks for chatting with us! Please don't hesitate to reach back out to us if you have any further questions. ","Hi! I'm Brandon, and I can absolutely help with that. I have iOS 11 too!

Perfect! Now, let's tap on ""Accounts & 1words"". You should see it if you scroll down a little bit. There you should be an icon with a white key in the middle. 

Good! There should be a list of your current accounts, click on ""Add Account"". 

Awesome, click on the Outlook.com option. Do you see that?

Although I might not have any professional experience with technology, I am completely obsessed with it. i believe I have well-rounded knowledge surrounding many subjects of tech. I also have a burning 1ion to help others. I have always helped my friends with anything they need. One time, my friend asked me which iPhone they should get, and I even took some time out of my day to help my friend get a new phone at the Apple Store. It was an incredible experience because I could tell my friend was happy. 

I know I will definitely be helping people and even change their lives. In such a digital age, we are constantly surrounded by technology and we cannot be taken away from it.

I've tried to look around for similar opportunities, but they're not trustworthy. I looked at this just today and it clicked. I am so glad I found this and I am so glad that I can express my love for technology. Some people may judge me sometimes and think of me as weird  cause I spend so much time looking at websites about tech news.

First, can you try doing a hard reset on the phone? This is done by pressing and holding down the Lock/Wake button on the right side of your iPhone at the same time as pressing and holding down the Volume Down button on the left side of your iPhone.

Keep holding both buttons until you see the Apple logo displayed on the screen. Please let me know when/if you see it!

Okay, you're seeing the Apple logo? Great! Now you can let go of both the Lock/Wake button and the Volume Down button, and your iPhone should boot up and display the Lock screen.

Are you able to get into the phone okay now that it is displaying the Lock screen? Excellent!

First, it is important to make sure the battery isn't simply completely drained. If you tap your 'lock' button on the right hand side of your phone, see if a battery with a 'red' amount in the middle of it appears. If it does, it is likely that your phone is just on a very low battery!

However, if after a minute or two the battery doesn't appear- we may have to try something else.

(Assuming that the battery doesn't indeed show up)

Okay, no worries! We can definitely try something else. I found one of the best ways to fix this issue is to perform a hard reset.

First, press and hold the 'lock' button on the right hand side of your phone. Then, at the same time, press and hold down the 'volume down' button on the left side of your phone.

Keep holding down both the button and soon an Apple logo should appear on your screen.

Once that does so, wait a couple seconds and your lock screen should appear once again!

"From a Home screen, touch and swipe up or down to display all apps.
Note These instructions apply to Standard mode only.
From a Home screen, navigate: Settings Settings icon > Sounds and vibration Sound and Vibration icon.
Tap Ringtone then select a ringtone.
Tap the Home icon Home icon to exit.","First determing whether or not your Iphone won't turn on due to a hardware of software problem.  Check your lightning cable and your charger and try charging with another charger.  Make sure it's not the display. Restart iPhone
If charging the battery didn't turn your iPhone on, the next thing you should try is to restart the phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off.

Hard Reset the iPhone
Try a hard reset if the standard restart didn't do the trick. A hard reset is like a restart that clears more of the device's memory (but not its storage. You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 

Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down.)

Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't)
If the shut-down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons
When the white Apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let the phone start up.
4. Restore iPhone to Factory Settings
Sometimes your best bet is restoring your iPhone to its factory settings. This erases all the data and settings on your phone (hopefully you synced it recently and backed up your data), and can solve a lot of problems. Normally, you'd sync your iPhone and restore using iTunes, but if your iPhone won't turn on, try this:

Plug in the iPhone's USB cable to the Lightning/Dock Connector port, but not into your computer.
Hold down the iPhone's Home button (on an iPhone 7, hold volume down).
While holding the Home button, plug the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
This will open iTunes, put the iPhone into recovery mode, and let you completely restore the iPhone.","Hi Timothy, I would be more than happy to assist you with this.

"Hi Reggie, my name's Jorge!

I can definitely try to help you change your contact ringtones on your S8+.

I know that on your particular phone, you have the option to save contacts to your SIM card, or your phone. If the contacts are being saved to your SIM card, the options to customize each contact can be somewhat limited.

If you're unsure if your contacts are being saved to your device, let me know and we can double check a few settings before we get down to it.

All right, let's begin! 

We'll start by swiping up from the home screen on your phone. This will bring you to your apps tray.

From there, you're going to look for the app titled ""contacts"".

Let me know when you find it.

From there, you're going to want to click on the desired contact you want to assign the ringtone to. After clicking on the contact, click on the text that says ""details"". 

Then you're going to want to click on text that says ""edit"". 

After you click on 'edit', you're going to want to click on the text that reads 'more'.

The next text prompt will read 'ringtone'. Click on that. 

From here, it will come to a text prompt that reads 'Allow storage permission'. Go ahead and toggle to allow.

 From there, you can choose the ringtone you'd like to add to that contact. Take a minute and find the ringtone you want and click ok. Once you do you can click the back arrow in the upper left corner of the display to move out of the contact, and the ringtone you selected will save. 

Pretty easy, yeah? Are there any other questions you have?

If you think of some later, don't hesitate to reach back out to us.

It was great talking to you Reggie, glad I was able to help you out. 

Have a good rest of your day!



","Hey Jamie, my name's Jorge!

I'm sorry you're having issues with your iPhone, but I'm here to help you out as best I can!

So your screen shut off while your phone was charging. Does the phone appear to still be on, but the display is dark, or is the device completely powered off? I'd also be remiss if I didn't ask what cable you're using to charge your phone. Has it given you any issues prior to this? I'm curious to know because that will help me figure what's going on with your phone.

Let's start off by unplugging the phone from the charger. What I want you to try to do for me is to perform something called a force restart. On the iPhone 7, you can do this by holding the sleep/wake button and the bottom volume button simultaneously for 10-15 seconds, or until you see the Apple logo come back on. The sleep/wake button is the button on the right side of your iPhone. 

Try that for me first, and let me know what happens.

If your phone doesn't respond to the force restart, I want you to try to connect to the phone back to a power source and perform the force restart. 

Still not working? 

Jamie, do you have access to a computer with an up to date version of iTunes installed? If so, I want you to connect your iPhone to that computer and open up iTunes. 

Once you have connected your phone and have iTunes open, we're going to attempt to put your device into something called recovery mode. We'll do that by holding down the sleep/wake button and lower volume button for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, you will continue to hold the lower volume button, but let go of the sleep/wake button. Eventually, if done correctly, a prompt will show up on iTunes stating that the device is in recovery mode. 

On that same screen, it gives you the option to restore the phone. Understand Jamie, at this point, whatever information you had saved to your iPhone will be erased in order to get your iPhone back on. If you have been backing up your phone to iCloud or to your computer, you can still retrieve that information if your phone turns back on. 

If you're ok with that, go ahead and click restore. At this point, iTunes will begin downloading the iPhone software to your computer to restore the phone. This may take some time depending on your internet connection. 

If this works, your phone will power back on and it will come to the welcome screen and you can proceed to set it up again. If it does not work and it gives you an error, there may be something going on with your hardware and at this point many require you to visit the Apple Genius Bar. I would recommend booking a reservation at your local Apple store as I know they can get quite busy. You can do so by visiting www.apple.com/support

I really hope everything works out for you and you can get your phone up and running, Jamie. If I can help you out with anything else with your phone, feel free to let me know!

Next, let's check to make sure the charger or the cord are not faulty.  Do you have another charger or cable? Try changing those out.

Hello Reggie, let me with that. Go to Phone > Contacts > select person > select ""Details"" (info sign) > EDIT (Top of screen) > View more (Just above ""Scan Business Card"") > scroll down and you will see ringtone click that (allow permission 1st time) and it will bring up tones for you to choose from.","Step 1. Make sure your iPhone has sufficient charge to power up

To ensure that the problem is not due to insufficient charge, connect your iPhone to the original charger and allow it to charge for at least 30 minutes. Once your device has enough charge, try to turn your iPhone back on. If your iPhone’s battery is completely drained, let it charge for at least an hour and then try to turn it on again afterwards.

Step 2. Reboot your iPhone 7 or perform a force restart

After connecting your iPhone to an outlet and allowing it to charge for a few minutes, try to power it back on. To do so, press and hold the Sleep/Wake (Power) button until the Apple logo appears on the screen.

Step 3. Use iTunes to enter recovery mode and attempt to re-install iOS

If your iPhone 7 Plus turns on but gets stuck during start up, you would see symptoms like black screen, red screen, blue screen, or Apple logo for a long time during start up. If you are encountering any of these symptoms, connect your iPhone to a computer and use iTunes to enter Recovery Mode to reinstall iOS without erasing your data. Follow these steps when you’re ready

Connect your iPhone to a computer. On your computer open iTunes. Make sure you are using the latest version of iTunes program to prevent possible occurrence of software incompatibility issues.
Once your iPhone is successfully connected, force it to restart. Just press and hold the Power and Volume Down keys at the same time.
Do not release both keys when you see the Apple logo.
When the Recovery mode screen appears, release both keys.
If prompted with the option to Restore or Update, select Update to proceed.
Allow iTunes to attempt to reinstall iOS without erasing data on your iPhone. By then, iTunes will initiate downloading of the software for your iPhone 7.

Step 4. Put your iPhone in DFU Mode

Aside from recovery mode, your iPhone also has DFU mode or Device Firmware Update. It is another system state of your iPhone that is used to get your device to interface or communicate with iTunes without loading the operating system or iOS boot loader. The main reason why users would need to access DFU mode on their iPhone is to modify or change the device firmware, whether for iOS firmware downgrade or use of custom firmware on your iPhone.  

Follow these steps to put your iPhone 7 in DFU mode as your final attempt to fix black screen or power issue on it:

Plug in your iPhone 7 to a computer.
On your computer, make sure iTunes is running.
Turn off your iPhone 7 if necessary.
Press and hold down the Power button located on the right side of your iPhone 7 for 3 seconds.Press and hold the Volume Down button located on the left side of your iPhone 7 while keep holding down the Power button.
Keep holding both buttons for 10 seconds. If you see the Apple logo, it means that you have held the buttons too long and that you need to start all over. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
Release the Power button but keep holding down the Volume Down button for 5 seconds. If you see the Plug into iTunes screen, it means that you have held the button too long and that you will need to start all over.

Please let me know if this helps.","Hey Timothy,

That's okay--that narrows down what the problem might be. I know you may have tried this before you chatted in, but let's try simply powering your phone on, by holding down the power button on your phone.  The power button is on the right side, near the top.

2. Great! This is actually really easy and it should only take us a few minutes.  First thing to do is to open up the Contacts app on your phone and to find the contact that you want a specific ringtone for.  Let me know when you’re there.

3. Okay, next find where it says “Edit”, choose “More”, next find “Ringtone”.  You might get a prompt that says “Storage Allow”, if you do then choose “Allow”.  Finally, just choose the ringtone you want.  You should see a list of them.

4. Awesome! Glad to hear that worked for you.  If you have other issues, you can reach us back here at any time! There’s also a free manual and self-help guides available at <<LINK>>.  Again, my name was Jay. It was great working with you, Reggie. If you’re all set, feel free to end the chat!
","1. Hi Jamie! I’m Jay and I’m going to do my best to help you figure that out.  I’ve had a similar situation, but I had spilled water on my iPhone.  

2. I want to make sure I know what’s going on first though.  Did anything unusual happen? For example, did the phone get really hot or was there damage to the phone from a drop?

3. Great! Sounds like you take great care of your phone, I’m the same way.  Okay, we are going to try an easy step here to see if we can get it working.  Hold the button on the side of the phone and the button on the front for 5 seconds and let me know what happens.

4. No response? Okay, if the screens still black then just a few more questions.  Have you tried a different cable? And have you tried plugging it in anywhere else?

5. Okay, great let’s go ahead and plug it into your wife’s charger Jamie.  Let me know if you see a battery on the screen.

6. Awesome! That battery means that likely the charger is having some issues.  Is this the charger that comes with the phone by chance?

7. Okay, since it’s the charger that comes with the phone, there’s a really cool part of the Apple warranty that covers that charger and the cable.  Apple can replace those for you if they also determine it to be a fault. You can reach them at http://getsupport.apple.com and they’ll take great care of you.

I use email on my phone all the time, so I’m going to be the right person to help with this today.  There are actually two ways we can do this: Outlook has an application you can download that works great or we can use the built in mail app for iOS.  Did you have a preference?

2. I’d be happy to help you choose.  The outlook app has built in functionality that includes calendars and other features, so if you use those then that’s a great option.  If you’re not using Outlook’s options for those then the built in Mail app is phenomenal as it can automatically detect events and add them to your calendar if you want.

3. Awesome! Well let me help you set this up using iOS then! It’s really simple, we first need to get to Settings.  The icon for Settings looks like a grey gear.  Afterwards, scroll a bit down until you get to “Accounts & 1words”.  Tap that and let me know when you get there.

4. Okay, choose “Add Account”.  You’ll see it at the bottom of the list.  Another screen should come up where it lists types of services. At the bottom, right below AOL, you should see Outlook.com.  Choose that one.

5. Awesome job Timothy.  Now you just log in with your username and 1word.  That’ll get you set up!

6. Like I said before, there’s some great integration with Apple’s asssitant Siri here.  She can scan your email, give recommendations for travel times, add calendar events, and even dictate emails for you.  A fantastic tool that I use a lot.

","It’s all about providing customers with an experience that both resolved issues and provides them with an engaging conversational style from their support agent.

To locate your contacts swipe up or down to access the Apps screen. Tap the contacts app and find the contact you want to assign a ringtone to. 


When you select the contact tap on details and there should be an edit option on the right corner of the screen. 

Tap on the contact photo then swipe up and tap on ringtone. There you will find the different ringtones select the desired one. Once you have selected the ringtone tap the back arrow below to apply the changes and tap save. 

 Glad I could help! Does this resolve all of your concerns today?","Hello! I’m Andrew, I can help you troubleshoot your iPhone 7 to  see if it just needed to be restarted. Sometime phones freeze and turn off when they need to be rebooted.

Is your iPhone charging? It may not want to turn on just yet if the battery is too low. 

If your screen is black or frozen, you might need to force restart your device. A force restart won't erase the content on your device. You can force restart your device even if the screen is black or the buttons aren't responding. Press and hold both the side and volume down buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo.

Let me know if that worked. If it still isn't responding it might be that the charger isn't working properly so try with another charger. If your phone still isn't charging your charging port might be damaged and may need to be repaired. 

Glad I could help out.. Does this resolve all of your concerns today?

Thanks for chatting with us! Please do not hesitate to reach back out to us if you have any further questions. Don’t forget to rate us after your experience.","Hi! I'm Andrew, and I can absolutely help with that. I updated to the newest iOS too! How are you liking it so far?

"Hello, I'm Petar, and I'm happy to help you set a contact specific ringtone on your Samsung Galaxy phone.

Start by opening the contacts app. It's an orange icon with the outline of a person's head in white. Locate the contact you'd like to set a custom ringtone for. Tap the small ""i"" button that's circled. When you see ""Edit"" at the top of the screen, tap that. Scroll down, and near the bottom, you will see ""view more."" Tap view more, and you will see the ringtone options. Here you can set a custom ring tone and text message tone for that contact.

Repeat the same process for any other contacts you wish to customize.

When an iPhone unexpectedly freezes up or shuts off and won't seem to come back on, chances are forcing it to restart will help. You may have seen people pressing and holding their power and home buttons at the same time to force restart their iPhone - but this method doesn't work on your iPhone 7 due to the new style of home button.

To force your phone to restart, press and hold both the power button on the right side of the phone and the volume down button on the left. Hold both buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo shows on the screen, indicating that your phone is powering on. If that doesn't happen, let go of the buttons after 15 seconds and then just press and hold power like you would normally power on your phone.

Let me know if that resolved your issue or if you have any further questions.","Hello, I'm Petar, and I'm happy to help you add your Outlook email account to your new iPhone.

Start by opening your iPhone's settings. The icon is a gray gear wheel. From there, scroll down to Accounts & 1words, with a gray key icon. At the very bottom of the Accounts section, tap Add Account. When promoted to choose the account type, tap Outlook.com, the last option above Other.

You will now find yourself at the Microsoft account sign-in page. Go ahead and enter your complete Outlook.com email address, and then your 1word when prompted.

Once you are finished setting up your account, you have several options to customize, such as how frequently to retrieve emails, email signatures, what to sync, how far back to retrieve emails, and how long to keep them. Let me know if you'd like to explore these options.

Let me know if that resolved your issue, and if you have any further questions.","I think that as an Anywhere Expert, I'll be helping people understand their electronic devices, and helping them overcome the learning curve associated with owning a new gadget. I want to be an Anywhere Expert because I believe I will be good at it, and I will enjoy it. I have extensive experience with mobile phones and other similar devices.

At age 14, I began repairing smartphones for myself and for classmates. Didn't take long to realise I could monetize it. I ended up doing a lot of phone repair, and ages 17-19 I was the lead technician and manager at our local phone repair shop.

I've also done an extensive amount of fiddling around with the software of phones, such as jailbreaking iPhones and rooting android phones. I've installed many custom ROMs on Android phones and windows phones, and modified them further myself. This isn't something I consider useful at this point, but it's given me a very strong understanding of iOS and Android, and I consider myself an expert in most everything pertaining to both operating systems. 

I'm the go-to guy for tech support among my family, friends, friends of friends, colleagues, etc. I have a lot of experience teaching people how to use their devices and walking them through troubleshooting steps. At my last job I was data controller, in charge of a financial database, and a large part of my job was teaching others to use the database and the data matpping tools I created for it. Before that, I was data director for a political campaign, so it was my responsibility to make sure everyone was trained and properly using the voter database. I was also in charge of all the campaign phones and teaching people how to use various aspects of them.

I can't think of anything I'm more qualified to do than helping people use their electronic devices. I've also taken electronics classes that went much deeper into troubleshooting of electrical components, so I have a well rounded understanding of tech in general.

I look forward to being part of your team!",1,1,1,79,,1

If charging the battery didn't turn your iPhone on, the next thing you should try is to restart the phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off. If the phone was off, let it turn on. If it was on, restarting it by turning it off and then turning it back on is probably a good idea.

How to set up and access Microsoft Outlook email on iPhone and iPad

If Microsoft Outlook.com — Live or Hotmail if you're retro — is your mail, contacts, and calendar provider of choice, it's easy to set up and access it right on your iPhone or iPad. Microsoft might have taken a while, and gone through a lot of names and iterations, to get their online consumer services into the modern age, but what they've finally settled on is impressive. There's Exchange if you need ActiveSync. If you don't, there's Outlook.

How to add Outlook mail, calendar, contacts to your iPhone or iPad's Mail app

Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.
Tap on Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
Tap on Add Account.
Tap on Outlook.com.
Enter your Outlook.com username and 1word and then tap Next in the upper right hand corner.
Choose the services you'd like to enable and sync with Outlook and then tap Save in the upper right hand corner.
And you're done! You will miss out on any web-specific features, which are what Microsoft is working to make all shiny and revolutionary, but you will get all your mail in the unified inbox, right beside iCloud and Gmail if you use those services as well. You can also set up Outlook.com as an Exchange account. Just follow the same steps above but choose the Exchange option for account type and use m.hotmail.com as your server.",As a Anywhere Expert my ultimate goal will be to give the best customer service and provide solutions to solving my customers issues .

If your phone was off, you should see the phone beginning to turn on. If the phone was on, go ahead and power the phone down and turn it back on to restart it.

It may sound obvious, but be sure your iPhone's battery is charged enough to run the phone.

To test this, plug your iPhone into a wall charger or into your computer. Let it charge for 15-30 minutes. It may turn on automatically. You may also need to hold down the on/off button to turn it on.
If you suspect your phone ran out of battery but recharging doesn't work, it's possible that your charger or cable is faulty. Try using another cable to double check. (P.S. In case you haven't heard, you can now get wireless charging for the iPhone.)

"Hello! I’m Kimberly and I’ll be more than happy to help you change the ringtone for a specific contact on your Galaxy S8+! I know how important customization is on your device.

 I can walk you through this in a few steps. I may have a few questions as we go to better assist you. If you have any questions at all along the way please let me know.  

The first thing we’re going to do is go to the phone icon. Next, select “Contacts”.  Scroll down to the person that you’d like to customize the ringtone for. Let me know once you’re at the contact please.

Great! Next select the “Details” icon. It looks like an exclamation mark. After that please select “Edit” at the top of the screen. The next step is to select “View More” which is just above where it says “Scan Business Card”. Let me know once you’re there please.

Excellent! Thank you! We’re almost done now! Next, please scroll down to “Ringtone” and select that. You may be asked to allow permission if this is your first time changing it. If so, agree to the permission. After that the ringtone list should appear. Click the one that you’d like for that contact and select save. 

Let me know once you’ve saved the ringtone please. 

Wonderful!!! Now you’ll have that great customized ringtone every time that person calls you!

","Hello! My name is Kimberly and it will be my pleasure to assist you with your iPhone 7 today. I’m sorry your screen shut off while your phone was charging. I know how important our phones are to our every day lives. 

I may have a few questions as we go in order to better assist you. If you have any questions along the way please let me know. I’m here to help.

Is there any message or icon flashing when you try to turn the phone back on?

Thanks for that information. I know that iPhone 7 is a little different than previous models because the Home key doesn’t press down when the phone is off. So, we’re going to do a soft reset, but it’ll be a little different than the soft reset on earlier models, ok?

Great! So, what we’re going to do is plug the phone up in case it didn’t finish charging earlier. Let know once it’s plugged in please. 

Thank you! Next, hold down the Power/Lock button on the right side of the phone and the down volume button at the same time. Hold them down for about 30 seconds and you should see a slight screen flash and it should restart. Please let me know once the phone restarts and if you can get into it.

Awesome!!! You should be good to go now. Now you can continue enjoying your iPhone 7! Have I resolved your issue today?

","Hello! I’m Kimberly and I’ll be more than happy to help you add your Outlook.com email to your new iPhone. I understand how important access to emails on the go are. 

I may have a few questions as we go to better assist you. If you have any questions along the way please let me know. I’m here to help.

Now I know you said you think you’re running the newest iOS, but let’s double check to make sure.

Please open your Settings. It looks like a gray gear. Next, go to “General” then go to “Software Update”. That’ll let you know which version of iOS you have and if it’s the most up to date one. What version does it say?

Excellent! So you are up to date. Let’s get that email account added now!

Please click “General” in the upper left hand corner. You should move back a screen. From that screen click “Settings” in the upper left hand corner. You should be back at the main Settings menu. You’ll see “Settings” in bold in the upper left hand corner and your name will be in bold under that. Please let me know when you’re back.

Super! Next, scroll down until you see a gray icon shaped like a key. It’ll say “Accounts & 1words”. Click that then click “Add Account”. 

From here you should see a list of email providers. Select Outlook.com and enter your email, phone number, or Skype id. You may be asked to verify whichever option you enter. Please verify and click Next. Next, enter your 1word and select “Sign In”. You may be asked to verify your identity again by several options. You can have the verification code texted or emailed to you or use the verification code from the app. Text is easier, but let me know which option you select so that we may proceed please. 

Thank you. Text was a great choice. Select text and you’ll get a verification code to your phone number. You should see the last 2 numbers of the phone number on the button that you’re selecting to text. 

Once you get the code, enter it and click “Next”. You’ll be asked for permission to sync contacts and mail; access your profile and information; and sign you in. This is pretty standard and required to continue.

Select “Yes” and you’ll be taken to the next page where you can select exactly which options you’d like to sync. Make sure you at least select “Mail” and select any others that you would like to sync up to your phone. Then click “Save”. It should quickly show “Account Added” and take you back to the main screen. Let me know when that happens please.

Super! Now, just to verify that it was done, go to your “Mail” icon (looks like a white envelope on a blue background). You should see all of your email accounts listed. Do you see Outlook?

Great! Select that and wait a few seconds to make sure your emails are there. Let me know once you see them please.

Yay! You have Outlook set up now! Have I successfully resolved your issue today?

Thank you! Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you have any other questions or concerns. Have an awesome day!

Can I have your name please?

Nice to meet you (insert customer's name).

May I ask when did this issue start?

If your screen is black or frozen, you might need to force restart your device. A force restart won't erase the content on your device. You can force restart your device even if the screen is black or the buttons aren't responding. Follow these steps:

•On an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus: Press and hold both the Side and Volume Down buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo.

If your device still won't turn on or start up:
Plug in your device and let it charge for up to one hour.
After a few minutes, you should see the charging screen.
 
If you don't see the charging screen within an hour, or you see the connect to power screen, check the jack, USB cable, and power adapter. Make sure that everything is plugged in firmly, free of debris, and not damaged. You might want to try a different USB cable or power adapter.

If you see the Apple logo or a red or blue screen during startup, try these steps:
1. Connect your device to a computer and open iTunes. If you don't have a computer, try to borrow one, or go to an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for help. 
2. While your device is connected, force it to restart.
Press and hold the Side and Volume Down buttons at the same time. Keep holding them until you see the recovery-mode screen.
3. Don't release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Keep holding until you see the recovery mode screen.
4. When you get the option to restore or update, choose Update. iTunes will try to reinstall iOS without erasing your data.
 
iTunes will download the software for your device. If it takes more than 15 minutes, your device will exit recovery mode and you'll need to repeat steps 2 and 3.

"Hi, I am Saied i will be assisting you today. I would be glad to help you with your ring tone fast and easy as possible. first open the Contacts app. Find the contact you wish to modify. Click the small circled ""i Details"" button. Then At the top of the next screen, click the Edit button.
In the edit screen, scroll down near the bottom, right above the SCAN BUSINESS CARD button, and click on the View More option. Scroll down, and you will see the Ringtone field. Edit that, and you're good. And you should be good. If not do not hesitate to come back. Hope this works and hope you have a fantastic rest of your day","I'm so sorry to hear that, I'm Saied i will be helping you with all my power to fix your issue. First, It may sound obvious, but be sure your iPhone's battery is charged enough to run the phone.


To test this, plug your iPhone into a wall charger or into your computer. Let it charge for 15-30 minutes. It may turn on automatically. You may also need to hold down the on/off button to turn it on.

If you suspect your phone ran out of battery but recharging doesn't work, it's possible that your charger or cable is faulty. Try using another cable to double check. Second, If charging the battery didn't turn your iPhone on, the next thing you should try is to restart the phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. Third, Try a hard reset if the standard restart didn't do the trick. A hard reset is like a restart that clears more of the device's memory (but not its storage. You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 

Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down. And if your iphone 7 still does not turn on you should contact the store/person you bought it from. I really hope this helped and again i'm Saied and you have a great rest of your day.








","How are you doing today? I am Saied i will be helping you today with your problem. In the new iOS 11, you can no longer find the ""Accounts"" option in the ""Mail"" settings, nor in ""Calendar"" or ""Contacts."" Instead, everything is found within a new settings menu called ""Accounts & 1words."" Apart from that small change, adding email accounts in iOS 11 is very straightforward, and you basically follow the same process of signing in and syncing your email addresses from iOS 10. To go over the process step by step, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Once inside, scroll down and select ""Accounts & 1words"" from the list of options. From there, tap on ""Add Account,"" and choose the email service you'd like to sign into. 
After you've chosen your email service, simply follow the on-screen instructions in order to sign in with your email address and 1word. Depending on what service you choose, a permissions prompt might appear detailing various application permissions your email account will have access to, so tap on ""Yes"" to proceed.

You will now be taken to your account's settings page where you'll have the option to select which apps can access and sync with it, such as Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes. After choosing which apps you want to sync with your email account, tap on ""Save"" to finish up. Hope this works if not do not hesitate to come back and again my name is Saied. And you have a great rest of your day.

I hate that you are having problems with your Iphone7 but I can definitely assist you.
Has this happen before?
Have you disconnected the phone from the charger port?
Ok great
So, before your phone shut off, what were you doing? (Surfing the web, listening to Pandora, on Facebook)?
Ok great! Yeah I love listening to pandora!
And when it shut off did it make any kind of noise or show any kind of error message?
Ok
Was the phone in any way hot in temperature?
Ok that could be dangerous.
Do you remember what color the screen was before it shut off?
Awesome. 
So it sounds like the phone overheated. 
Make sure the phone is laying flat, not propped on anything, not directly in sunlight, and that nothing is restricting charger.
Let the phone cool down for about 10minutes.
Ok great, does it feel cool now?
Good..
Since it has cooled down,plug phone back up to the charger, and it should come back on as before. 
Did it come back on?

","Hi my name is MJ and I will be happy to help you in checking out your iphone7... 

I would like to ask is the screen just off or did it turn off the entire phone? 

there are a couple of things we can try to assist in this issue....

Recharge
If you see the red empty battery icon your iPhone may not be able to work at all until there is a minimum charge in the battery.
If the iPhone’s battery is totally drained you may not see the battery recharge image for several minutes. If the display is blank when you plug it in wait a while to see if the icon makes an appearance.
If you see the red ‘filler’ of the battery icon flash three times and then the screen goes black, it means that iPhone is not receiving power to charge.
 
Restart
Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the right top side of the phone.
If the iPhone is frozen and can’t be restarted in the normal way do the following:
Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to force a restart.

Reset
Click on Settings then General then Reset All Settings
This will perform a reset of all the settings to the factory defaults. The data or content on the iPhone is unaffected.

Restore
If all else 0s, you will need to perform a full back up and Restore your iPhone.
First of all, make sure you’ve got the latest version of iTunes. Then connect your iPhone to your PC or Mac and select it when it appears under Devices in iTunes.
If you haven’t performed a Sync recently do so now to make sure all your contacts, photos and videos are up to date. Click on the Summary tab and then click Restore.
If you haven’t backed up your iPhone you will be told to do so now. This will back up all the data and settings on your iPhone.
Click on Restore. Wait until your iPhone completes the restore process and resets to the Home screen.

Force device into recovery mode

Beware: Recovery mode erases all the data on your device. Only follow these steps if you have a recent back up on iCloud or a computer.
Turn off your iOS device.
Plug the USB cable into your computer – but not into the device
Hold down the Home button then plug the USB cable into the device
When you see the Connect to iTunes screen (below), release the Home button. If you don’t see this screen, repeat steps 1 to 3.

How did everything go?
Was there anything else you needed assistance with or did I cover all your problems.

If you have future questions contact us anytime, have a wonderful day ... good-bye

","I believe that I will be assisting others in technological dilemmas that they may have and cannot find the answers to or help with.  I believe that I will be apart of a new way of helping others thru the fast growing world of technology.  A break thru in the way help is asked for and provided and being the real person on the other end to assist those you need a little bit more than a google search or instructions that might as well be written in Chinese.  

I have always been the ""techno geek"" or ""Google"" (their words or nicknames for me) of my family and friends and spent time as a technology advisor as Staples Inc. I came across an ad in a virtual job posting and figured why not help people and get paid at the same time all with the convenience of my own hours anywhere I would like to be at the time.   I do a variety of things online including start up, public relations, marketing, advertising, writing, and am a photographer all which allow me to use my technical skills and would like to help others benefit from my skills as well. I am also not scared if I do not know the problem or how to solved to confidently find the solution and share that with others.

"Hello Reggie. My name is Andy Herrera and I'd be happy to help you set a personal ringtone for a specific contact in your Samsung Galaxy S8+! I know that with all of the different options to customize your phone it can be a little daunting sometimes to find the right setting, but no worries, I'll do everything in my abilities to assist. 

Is this S8+ a new phone?

Awesome, I hope you are enjoying the new phone. I just got my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 not long ago, I'm a huge fan of the Galaxy lines. It took me a little while to get it customized to my liking too so I know the struggle!

Reggie, to change the ringtone for a specific contact I'll have you try the following steps:

Go to Contacts by either opening the Dialer app (It's the green icon that looks like a telephone handset) and selecting ""Contacts"" from the upper options, or you could open the App drawer and select the ""Contacts"" (I believe on Samsung it is an orange icon with the silhouette of a person's head).

From there scroll to the name of the Contact whose ringtone you would like to change, tap the name and hit the Details option. This should pull up the details for the contact stored in your phone. At the top part of the screen there is an ""Edit"" button to edit the contact information. Select ""Edit"" and scroll down to the ""View more"" drop down arrow and select that which should display more information which can be edited.

If you scroll down there should be a box for ""Ringtone"". If you tap on ringtone all of the available ringtones should pop up on your screen. There may be a prompt stating ""Complete action using"" asking you which specific app you would like to use to select the ringtone (this generally pops up if you have a File Explorer app on your phone as the phone is asking if you want to use your File Explorer app or the File Explorer built into the phone). If the ""Complete action using"" prompt does pop up I always recommend using the native app that came with the phone unless you are more comfortable using the File Explorer app you downloaded yourself.

After you select whichever ringtone you want for said contact you simply tap ""Save"" at the top of the screen and the contact should now be saved with a custom ringtone.

Was there anything else I could help you with while I have you here Reggie?

Thanks again for reaching out, we are always here to help. Again my name is Andy Herrera and I hope you have a great rest of the day!","Hello Jamie. My name is Andy Herrera. I'm sorry to hear about your phone not powering back on, I know how frustrating it can be when technology doesn't want to cooperate. I'd be happy to assist in getting your phone to boot back on. I know how gut wrenching it can be to just stare at a blank screen waiting on your phone to boot as I've had it happen to me before so no worries you totally aren't alone on this. Is this the first time you are encountering this issue on your iPhone 7?

Okay so this seems to be an isolated incident, well it's good to know that this seems to be the only case. No need to panic just yet Jamie, I'll do everything in my power to assist you with this issue.

Do you recall how much charge there was left on the battery before the screen shut off?

Okay so it was close to fully charged, so it should ideally still have a little juice left.

Jamie, is the phone still plugged into the charger?

That's perfectly fine, if you don't mind keeping it unplugged while we try to get this issue resolved.

Do me a favor Jamie, can you hold down the Home button while you hold down the power button while you try to boot it back on again? Sometimes it takes a little while to do so, I would give it at least a full ten seconds holding both down.

That worked?! Awesome!!! I had a feeling that it might as it sounded very similar to the issue I ran across with my iPhone.

Is the charger being used a certified Apple charger?

Ah, that may be the culprit. We always recommend using only certified charging cables when dealing with any electronics to avoid any potential issues of mismatching capacities with cables.

I'm glad to hear that your phone is back up and running Jamie!

Is there anything else I could assist you with while I have you here?

Thanks for reaching out, again my name is Andy Herrera and I hope you have a great day!","Hey Timothy, my name is Andy Herrera and I would be happy to help you add your Outlook email to your new iPhone. I know how those firmware updates can really change the game on smartphones and totally throw anyone for a loop. No worries though, I'll gladly assist setting up your outlook e-mail.

Firstly, congratulations on the new phone! Secondly, have you had your outlook e-mail on your iPhones in the past or is this a brand new setup?

Okay sounds good, you'll be using the same login information that you have in the past, it's just with the update there have been a few changes and some settings may not be in the same place as previously so it's almost like learning a brand new phone so don't fret! These firmware updates have even the most techy of us going in circles sometimes.

From your iPhone I'll have you open your ""Settings"" it's the icon that looks like a gear.

Once you are in the Settings screen scroll down until you see the ""Accounts & 1words"" tab, it's usually after ""Privacy"" and before ""Mail"".

Once you select that there will be an option to ""Add Accounts"" on the screen under the ""Accounts"" section.

When you select ""Add Account"" a list of various account platforms will popup. Select ""Outlook.com"".

It will then ask you the login information for the Outlook e-mail you would like to add. Once entered it should take you right back to the ""Accounts"" screen where your Outlook e-mail will pop up.

Did that work for you Timothy?

Awesome, glad to hear it!

Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you here Timothy?

Thanks for reaching out for help with establishing your Outlook.com e-mail on your new iPhone. Again my name is Andy Herrera. I hope you have a great rest of the day!



","I feel like I will be doing what I do on an almost daily basis with my friends and family.... help them when they get stuck with their technology issues!

You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 1. Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down. 2. Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't) Also if you suspect your phone ran out of battery but recharging doesn't work, it's possible that your charger or cable is faulty. Try using another cable to double check. Is this your only problem today? If not please ask i would love to answer it. If so it is you have a great rest of your day.","Hi, i'm Saied i will be assisting you today with your problem. To go over the process step by step, open the Settings app on your iPhone.

On your iPhone 7, Press and hold both the Side and Volume Down buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo pop up.

"Hi! My name isn’t Jessica and I am happy to help you get your ringtone changed on your galaxy s8!

To start, we need to make sure you are in a setting that does not require complete silence, a movie theater or business meeting are not the places to try and change this setting!

Great! So now that we know your kicking back at home we can get started.  There are a couple different ways you can change your ringtone.  One way is to go to your “settings” app, this is the app that looks like a gear box, once you are in there you can go to the “sounds” setting, this setting has a speaker next to it. Once sounds are opened you can tap on “ringtones” all of the available ringtones should now be visible in a list. As you tap on each ringtone it will send a preview of the highlighted ringtones.  Once you get to the ringtone you want, just don’t open anymore, the highlighted ringtone will be the default ringtone now. 

Ok so now that we have gone through all the steps, have you found the ringtone you want?

Great! Have I answered all you questions?

That is great to hear! Glad I was able to help with your ringtone! Please don’t hesitate to contact us again with any other questions you have!","Hi, my name isn’t Jessica and I am happy to help you get your iPhone 7 screen back on!

Ok let’s try one thing first, I’m sure you have already tried but humor me, I know my iPhone likes to be temperamental at times so let’s just try a couple things before we dive into it. Sound good?

Great! Ok so when you first plugged your phone in was it totally dead, like shut off, or did the battery have some life left?

Ok so since it wasn’t totally dead, unplug it for a second and then hit the side button to try and turn the screen on. Did that work?

Ok don’t worry, it didn’t turn on this time but we will get you there ok?

We are going to do a force restart, it will only take a couple minutes and you won’t lose any of your data. Are you ok with this?

Awesome!  Since you have the iPhone 7, you are going to want to hold down the “volume down” button at the same time asmyour side button. Hold them both until the apple logo appears, this will take at least 10secinds so be patient with it.  

Ok now that you’ve given it a few seconds, has the logo appeared? 

Perfect!  Now just be patient while your iPhone restarts. I’m still here so let me know when it is back on, it should only take a minute or two.

Ok is it back on now?

First of all, are you connected to WiFi or are you using your cellular data?

Awesome! WiFi works best when you are doing this since it will take some data, we don’t want you using up all you data unless you have to!

Ok so first if all let’s get your “settings” opened up. You can do this by either clicking the silver gear bos icon or simply search for “settings” in the search bar on the far menu page.

Great! Now scroll down to “accounts and 1words” and open that menu. Now click on “add new account” and tap on the “outlook.com” tab at the bottom of the menu.  Got it?

Issues like this often feel worse than they really are, with that phone still plugged into the charger (make sure it is a wall outlet too for this) go ahead and press the volume down button, and the side button (the one you lock your screen with) both down at the same time for about 15 seconds.

After that you should see that lovely apple logo pop up on your screen. 

[if the two button reset didn’t fix it, we would confirm the power source was good with another phone or device, or try another cable, and then we would move on to recovery mode steps. I would want to probe for backups first with them, and check iCloud to see what they had synced.]

I’m glad this ended up being a quick fix for you Jamie! Before we end things I want to check, have I resolved all your concerns today?

Wonderful! Never hesitate to chat back in if you ever need help. Have a good rest of the day!

","Hey Timothy, thanks for chatting! My name is Matt, and I would be happy to help you out with this email set up.

I appreciate you letting me know which version you are on, that helps me know what your settings should look like. 

To find the settings look for the gray app with the gear as the icon. From there we need to find Accounts & 1words, one good swipe should get you far enough down the settings to spot it. 

This is where you will add any new accounts to your phone, iCloud is likely already showing here, so under that will be the add account option. 

Once you tap on add account you will want to select outlook.com as the type and you will be able to enter your account information here.

Go ahead and get that added and let me know if you have any issues.

Ok great! I’m glad we could get that all set up for you, before we go I’d like to make sure I was able to resolve all your issues, and that you don’t have any final questions.

It has been great working with you Timothy! Feel free to reach out again if you ever need help. Enjoy the rest of your day!","I hope to be able to give regular people easy to follow instructions on how to get the most out of their devices. I enjoy the satisfaction I get from helping someone untangle the their thoughts and gain understanding of how we fixed it instead of just simply fixing things. I am a very patient person and don’t want anyone to feel they were rushed when being helped. I am a pretty personable person, but a good read of people too. I’m able to identify when someone needs me to cut the fluff and get down to business, or when someone just needs them to talk them out of their panic attack so that we can find their photos. I think I’ll do well here, and find the whole idea pretty revolutionary. Freelance technical support is a pretty solid idea.",0,1,1,84,2,1

2. Open the Contacts app and search for the specific contact that you wish to modify. Click the small circled ""Details"" button.

6. Select the desired ringtone then tap OK. And you're done!

Please let me know if you have questions about any of these steps. I would gladly assist you. 

Thank you!


","Hello, Jamie! This is Mariane. I know you are worried about your phone but don't worry! I'll do my best to help you today! 

You said that the screen of your iPhone 7 shut off while you were charging it and now it won't turn back on. Is that correct?

There are several reasons as to why this happens to an iPhone 7. It could be a software app malfunction, insufficient battery power, and physical/liquid damage on the hardware. 

You can try ANY of these suggestion/s:

1. Please make sure that your iPhone is sufficiently charged to turn on. Allow your iPhone to charge for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. After charging it up, try to turn it on.

2. You can also reboot your iPhone 7 by pressing and holding the Power button located on the upper right side of your iPhone. Press and hold this until the Apple logo appears on the screen. 

You can also force restart your iPhone by pressing and holding the Power button (located on the upper right side of your iPhone) and Volume Down button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. Do this until the Apple logo appears on the screen.

3. Use iTunes to enter recovery mode and attempt to re-install iOS. 
Connect your iPhone to a computer. 
Open iTunes. Make sure that you are using the latest version of iTunes. 
Once your iPhone is successfully connected, force it to restart. Just press and hold the Power and Volume Down keys at the same time. Do not release both keys when you see the Apple logo. 
When the Recovery mode screen appears, release both keys. 
If prompted with the option to Restore or Update, select Update to proceed.
Allow iTunes to attempt to reinstall iOS without erasing data on your iPhone. By then, iTunes will initiate downloading of the software for your iPhone 7.

Your iPhone will exit recovery mode if the download takes more than 15 minutes. By then, you will need to repeat steps 2-5.

4. Put your iPhone in DFU Mode (Device Firmware Update).

Plug in your iPhone 7 to a computer.
Open iTunes.
Turn off your iPhone 7 if necessary.
Press and hold down the Power button located on the upper right side of your iPhone 7 for 3 seconds.
Press and hold the Volume Down button located on the upper left side of your iPhone 7 while keep holding down the Power button.
Keep holding both buttons for 10 seconds. If you see the Apple logo, it means that you have held the buttons too long and that you need to start all over. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.
Release the Power button but keep holding down the Volume Down button for 5 seconds. If you see the Plug into iTunes screen, it means that you have held the button too long and that you will need to start all over.

If your iPhone 7 screen remains black, that denotes that your device is already in DFU mode. At this point, iTunes will prompt an alert message saying that it has detected your iPhone 7 and will let restore.

5. Contact Apple Support.
If none of the above suggestions work, please contact the Apple Support for more options about this issue.

I hope one of these suggestions will solve the issue on your iPhone. Please let me know if you need any other assistance. 

Thank you!

"Hi there, my name is Katelyn. I also like to have different ringtones for specific contacts, so I'd be happy to help you out with that.
The first thing you’re going to do is open your contacts app. This is an orange icon with a person symbol on it. Once you have it open, you need to find the contact you’d like to add the ringtone to, go to the Details, and click EDIT. There will a “More” option, which will take to you to a bunch of options, including “Ringtone”. Click this. Select “Allow Storage permission” and then ALLOW. This lets you access your storage through the Contacts app. Choose the ringtone you’d like to assign to the contact. Make sure you then click OK and the back arrow in the upper left. I’d hate for you to go through all of these steps and then have your work not save!
I’m glad I got to help you customize your phone to your liking. It’s always nice to personalize your technology. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Have a great day! Goodbye.","Hi Jamie, my name is Katelyn and I’m here to help. I know from experience how frustrating it can be to have a phone stop working, so let’s get this resolved as soon as possible.
First off, does anything appear on the screen when you remove it from the charger and then plug it back in? If it’s charging, a symbol that looks like the end of your charger and a battery bar should appear. You’ll just need to wait until it’s charged enough to turn back on. If it’s not charging, then only the charger symbol will appear. If this is the case, you may need a new charger. 
If nothing appears on the screen when you plug it in, you can try a hard reset. Since you have an iPhone 7, you’ll need to hold down the wake/sleep button on the right side and the volume down button on the left side. Hold these simultaneously for 10 seconds. Then wait 10 seconds and try turning your phone back on by holding down the wake/sleep button. If your screen remains black, you may need to visit an Apple store. Use this link to find the store nearest to you: https://www.apple.com/retail/
Would you like to try to make a back-up of your data from your phone right now? If so, you’re going to need to connect your phone to your computer using a charging cable. Once, you’re connected, you need to open up iTunes. Find the phone icon either in the top right or middle of the app, depending on the version you’re using, and click on it. You’ll see a button that says “Back up now”. After clicking on it, it’ll automatically start backing up your phone and a loading bar will appear. Once the bar is full, you’re done. If you do end up needing a new phone, you can restore your old data to the phone using your back up.
Thanks for chatting with me. I also have an Apple phone, so I hope you have a great day iPhone buddy!","Hello Timothy, my name is Katelyn. Congrats on the new phone! Let’s go ahead and get your Outlook.com email added to your phone.
Before we start, I just want to verify that you do have iOS 11, because things will be a little different if you don’t. You can check your iOS by going to the settings app. This appears as a grey gear icon. Once you open it, go to General and then Software Update. A display will appear that tells you your iOS. 
Now to add your email, you’ll just need to open the settings app and find “Accounts & 1words”. This will be at the top of the fifth block of options. You’ll click “Add new account” and select Outlook.com. You’ll be prompted to enter in the email you’d like to add and then your 1word. You’ll need to give iOS permission to access your Outlook information. Choose which apps you’d like to sync, making sure you hit Save in the top right after. And you’re done! You can later edit the app syncing at any time by selecting your email from the “Accounts & 1word” page.
Setting up a new phone can be tricky, so while I’m here, is there anything else I can help you out with? 
Hope you enjoy the new phone. Nice talking to you Timothy!","I love helping people and I love puzzles. I currently work in IT and I honestly enjoy it because of both of those interests.

Let's begin by preforming a Force Restart. 

Press and hold down the Sleep/Wake and the Volume Down button at the same time.  Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen. Once you see this screen, you can let go of the buttons. If you  get to the Apple Logo screen, be sure to see if it stays on and operational. If it does, you will have successfully fixed your issue. 

If you do not see a the Apple Logo, we will need to try making sure your charger is fully plugged in and charging. It needs to charge for at least an hour in order for the phone to turn back on.

If it doesn't seem to be responding after an hour, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone or iPad and see if it shuts down again. If not, great!

If you are still experiencing issues, we will need to Restore your phone in iTunes. Go ahead and do the following

Connect your iOS device to iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC using your device's charging cable. 
Click on the Device button at the top left.
Click on Back Up Now.
Wait for the backup to finish.
Click on Restore iPhone… (or whatever iOS device you've connected).
Wait for the restore to finish.

When you're all done, see if your iPhone or iPad stays on. If so, wonderful! If not, you will need to Contact Apple at 1-800-MY-APPLE.

I hope I have resolved all your concerns today.

"Hello! My name is Brook! I would be more than happy to provide a solution of changing your ringtone to a specific contact on your galaxy s8+ !  

Do you have the phone with you currently so I can assist you?

Okay great! Since you have the phone with you I would like for you to follow the following steps so that you can select that ringtone for a specific caller.

Assign a Personal Ringtone:

1.)From the Home screen, touch Apps.
2.)Touch Contacts.
3.)Touch the desired contact.
4.)Touch EDIT to edit the contact's information.
5.)Scroll to and touch Ringtone.
6.)Touch the preloaded ringtone you want to use and touch OK, or follow the instructions below to use a custom ringtone.

Now that you have followed all of those steps I have provided is your issue resolved & is there anything else that I may assist you with today?

Awesome! I am so glad that we have accomplished our goal of setting the ringtone to a specific caller! If you have any other questions or issues please reach out to us again at anytime we are more than happy to help! Have a fantastic rest of your day!
","Hello! My name is Brook and I will be assisting you today with your issue of your iPhone 7 shutting off while charging and will not come back on. 

What I would recommend we do for the iPhone 7 that is shutting off and won't come back on is that we do a hard reset. This can take several minutes to complete. Are you available for this amount of time to trouble shoot your issue?

Okay great! What I would like for you to do is the following steps please:

1. Force Restart
If your iPhone or iPad keeps shutting down, won't charge, or keeps crashing, it might be time for a hard reset. Whether it's really shutting down on its own, or it's rapidly depleting the battery due to rogue processes or Wi-Fi or cellular radio activity, a hard reset can help.

On an iPhone 7 or newer device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time.
On an iPhone 6s, iPad, or older device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time.
Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears). iOS devices with white faceplates will show a white launch screen. iOS devices with black faceplates will show a black launch screen.
When the launch screen appears, you can let go of the button combo.
Once your iPhone or iPad has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational. If it doesn't (or if it won't reboot) go on to the next step.


2. Plug in
If your iPhone or iPad is rapidly discharging, plug it in. Once the charging cable's in place, you should see it begin to charge and you'll be able to read the battery level. If it shows little to no charge, it means something drained your battery. If it shows a partially or fully charged battery, you may have another problem.

In either case, connect your iOS device to its charging cable, plug into an outlet or USB port, and start charging. Let it charge for an hour. If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone or iPad and see if it shuts down again. If not, great! If so, keep reading.

3. Restore
After trying the easy fixes, it's time to try the harder ones. In this case, restoring your iPhone or iPad in iTunes. iTunes is a safer bet than iCloud because it actually offloads, re-installs, and reloads your data rather than doing everything in-place and on your device. That can sometimes shake loose bad bits that even a hard reset or iCloud restore can't.

Connect your iOS device to iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC using your device's charging cable.
Click on the Device button at the top left.
Click on Back Up Now.
Wait for the backup to finish.
Click on Restore iPhone… (or whatever iOS device you've connected).
Wait for the restore to finish.

When you're all done, see if your iPhone or iPad stays on. If so, hallelujah! If not, there's one more thing to try.

4. Contact Apple
Sometimes a problem really is a problem. Like any electronic device, batteries can 0 and circuits can short. If you have AppleCare+, don't walk, run to get it fixed. If you don't, get an estimate and weigh the cost of repair against the cost of upgrading to a new device.

If you don't live close to an Apple Store, you can call 1-800-MY-APPLE in order to set up a mail-in repair. If you don't have AppleCare, you may have to pay for the call, but it's less of a waste than having a dead iPhone or iPad.

Was this information helpful to you? Did it resolve your issues with the black screen?

When I was dating my husband, I changed his ringtone so that I wouldn't miss his calls.  He's a firefighter and they have very limited times to talk!  So let's get started in getting your specific one with a new ringtone!  From the Home screen, swipe up on an empty spot to open the Apps tray.

I'm Chandra and I am going to be assisting you with your iphone 7 issue this evening.  How are you doing?  Great.  Even with an issue like this, there's always a rainbow on the other the end.  So you have an iPhone 7 and you say that it turned off while charging and has not been back on, correct?  Do you know how much battery life you had prior to the phone turning off?   Ok, so you don't know for sure, but you know it was pretty low.  That's fine.  Next let's check to see if the place you currently have it charging is working properly.  Do have anything close by that you can plug into socket that you know is working?  Or if you have your computer close by you can charge it using your USB cable.   So you had it charging via the wall socket.  So let's use your laptop this time just to be safe.  Please make sure you laptop is on and has a good battery charge.  Great you're at 85% charge.  Make sure it's plugged into an outlet as well.   Ok since we are using the laptop to charge your iphone - let's give it minute or two to get a little charge in case its completely dead. Ok, its been about 2 minutes now.  Let's check your phone and see if we can see if it's charging.  With the phone still plugged into the laptop, try pressing  and quickly releasing the Volume Down button. Then, press and hold the Side button until you see the Apple logo. Do you see the Apple logo or the red empty battery image?  Great you see the red empty battery image.  So it may be possible that your battery was not receiving enough power to charge earlier.   Just remember: always plug the iPhone into a high-powered USB source such as the main charger or one of the main USB ports on your computer that is plugged in.  Just keep iphone 7 plugged into your laptop until it is fully charged.  Have I answered all of your questions and/or resolve all of your issues this evening?   Excellent!  I am so happy that I have resolved your issues.  I hope you have a wonderful evening.  Thanks for using Anywhere Experts!","Hello Timothy, I'm Chandra and it's a pleasure to be speaking with you today.

Great.   Go to your home screen of your iOS device and click on Settings. Click on General.  Click on About.  Tell me the number after Version; this is the version of iOS installed on your  phone.  Great job, Timothy!  We know now that you have an iPhone 6s and you have verified that IOS 11 is installed.  So let's move on to getting Outlook installed.  We will need to go to the Apple store and download the Outlook app.  Are you familiar with downloading apps from the Apple Store? No.  Well, then let me walk you through it.  On your home screen, find the Apple Store app and open it. It's the icon with the capital A with a blue background.  Tap the magnifying glass on the bottom right of your screen.
Type the word Outlook and tap the search button.  You should now see the Outlook icon (Microsoft).  Tap Get it.  Enter your 1word for Apple.  Now we wait for the download to finish.  Once it's finished, please let me know.  It's finished.   Great job, Timothy!!   Now let's get Outlook configured.  Press the Home button to go back your home screen.  Tap on Outlook.com.   Tap Settings  Outlook app settings > Add Account > Add Email Account.  Next, type your full email address, then tap Add Account.  Make sure this is the same data that you are using as if you were accessing Outlook from your laptop.  It is... Good.  Tap Sign In.  Now we need to tap Yes or Allow to give Outlook permission to sync your calendar, contacts, etc.   Just let me know when you're done.  Done. 
 Excellent.   I want to make sure everything is working properly for you.  Let's check to see if the mail is getting to your inbox. Go ahead and open Outlook.  Do you see your mail? Yes.  Excellent!!  Now depending upon how much you email you have it could take a little while longer for all of your mail to be loaded.   So it looks like we did a lot of work today in such a short amount of time, Timothy!! LOL Yes, we did! LOL Is there anything else I can assist you with?  No, I believe I am all set.

Please double check your charger to be sure that it is properly inserted into the charging inlet on your iphone 7. Also check that your charger is securely plugged into an electrical outlet. By keeping your phone connected to the charger this will rule out that your phone has simply died. Once you have checked and determined that it isn't your chargers connection lets try another solution.

We are going to try and restart your phone. In order to restart an iphone 7 the volume down button must be held along with the side button on your phone. The volume button will be located on the left side of your phone and the side button that usually awakes the screen is located on the right. At the same time hold the volume down button and the side button until you see a white apple logo appear on the screen. This logo appearing indicates that the phone has been restarted.  

The logo usually appears on your screen for 1-2 minutes and then your lock screen should appear. Once your lock screen has appeared your restart has been successful. 

Please unplug the charger to your phone and re-plug it to make sure that your screen will not go black again. Once you have completed this test you should be able to navigate your phone as usual.

Have I adequately help you resolve the issue of your phone blacking out while its charging?

"Hi Reggie!  I'm Lindsey.  I'd be happy to help you change a ringtone for a specific contact! 

Do you know how to open your contacts on your phone  (Phone > Contacts)?  Select the person that you'd like to update and select Details (info sign).  Select Edit (top of screen), then View more (should be just above the box that says ""Scan Business Card"").  Scroll down and you will see ringtone.  Click that (you may have to allow permission for the 1st time) and it will bring up tones for you.  Let me know if you have any trouble. 
","Hi Jamie!  I'm Lindsey and I'd be happy to help you figure out what's going on with your iPhone 7.  I know how frustrating that can be!! 

There are a couple different reasons why your screen won't come on.  It could be Apps Malfunction (software issues) that are usually resolved with a quick reset.  It could be insufficient power (dead batter) and only a little extra time on the charger will help.  And lastly, it could be physical damage (here's hoping that's not the case!!!).  Let's examine each of these problems and see if we can get your iPhone back up and running!

How long has your phone been charging?  If it has been less than 30 minutes, I'd suggest giving it a little bit of time to get enough juice before trying to power it back on.  At this time, I'd also check to make sure there's no physical damage to the charging port.  Make sure it isn't overheating while plugged in, and that there's no visible damage to the phone or cord.  

After allowing it to charge, try turning it back on.  Press and hold the sleep/wake button (on the top right side of your phone) until the Apple logo appears on your screen.  Alternatively, you can force your iPhone to restart (this will not erase any of its contents) by holding the sleep/wake button and the volume down button for at least 10 seconds.  When you see the Apple logo, release both buttons.

If that doesn't help, we may need to connect your phone to iTunes and reinstall iOS.  Please let me know if you'd like to move forward with this solution.
","Hi Timothy! I'm Lindsey and I'd be happy to help you get your email added!  Let's check your software version first (it can get pretty confusing if you can't see which items I'm referring to because you're on a different operating system!).  

Tap Settings > General > About and scroll down to Version.  Hopefully that starts with 11!  If not, we'll need to get you updated to the current version.  To do that, just back out of the About screen by tapping General in the top left.  Then tap on Software Update, scroll down and tap on Download and Install (you may need to be sure your battery is charged and you're connected to wifi).

Once you're all updated, let's get your email added to your iphone!  Go back into settings, scroll down to Accounts & 1words, scroll down to Add Account.   Tap Outlook.com and login with your credentials.  

Did this help solve your problem?  Can I help with anything else?

My name is Renae and I would be more than happy to help you with the issue you're having! Just to make sure I am understanding correctly, Your IPhone 7 screen shut off while it was charging and now it will not come back on?
First, lets check if it was a charging issue. Do you have another Charging cable or port? If so, please try plugging your iPhone 7 into it and see if it shows sufficient charge or a low battery. If you do not, that is okay! Let's try something else! Let's restart your phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off.
If the phone was off, let it turn on. If it was on, restarting it by turning it off and then turning it back on is probably a good idea.
If this does not work, we will try a hard reset. For your iPhone 7, hold down on/off and volume down for at least ten seconds. If the shut down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons. If the white Apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let the phone start up.
If these options have not helped, the issue may be due to an IOS update. In this case, I'd advise you to contact your phone providers customer service. Is there anything else that I can help you with today? Thank you so much for contacting us here at Anywhere Expert!","Hello!

Once you have chosen Outlook.com, simply follow the on-screen instructions in order to sign in with your email address and 1word.

"Hello, my name is Thialynn. I would be more than happy to assist you in changing the ringtone for a specific contact. Go to the Contacts application;

Tap on the Edit alternative and after that on the MORE button;

2.If there’s enough battery left to power the device on, the white Apple logo will appear.
3.When this happens, release both keys and wait until the device reboots completely.

This is what you call Soft Reset. It’s hardwired in the phone so when the appropriate keys are pressed and held, the phone should restart. However, if it’s still not responding after that, then you need to do the next step.

Step 2: Make sure your iPhone 7 has sufficient battery to power up its components

Perhaps the reason why your phone turned off, won’t turn back on and respond to the soft reset method is because there’s not enough battery left. So, at this point, you need to plug your phone in to charge for at least 10 minutes. 

Plugging the charger in will charge your phone but the other thing we want to know is whether your iPhone 7 responds when it detects current flows through the circuits. If it remains unresponsive, then there’s a chance the battery or some of its components are damaged. Or, it may be just a charging issue, so here’s what you need to do next…
◦Physically check the cable for breakage
◦Look into the port on your charger for lint, debris or corrosion that may prevent charging
◦Try to check the pins to see if one of them is bent
◦Check the charging port of your phone for debris and corrosion
◦Try using a different charger

"Hello Reggie, I'm Bucky -- Just to be sure I'm clear on your issue, you're trying to change the ringtone for one contact in particular, is that correct?

Great! That's certainly something I can help you with today. Would you be able to navigate to the contact for me in your contacts app?

You're there? Alright, find the contact you're trying to set a ringtone for, tap on the entry for them. You should see an edit button for them towards the top right-ish of that window that comes up, it might look like like a little pencil. Go ahead and tap on that.

Nice, we're almost done. Now that you're in the edit contact window, the option for setting the contact ringtone should be buried in there. You might have to scroll down or hit more, but you want to find the line that says 'Ringtone'. Tap on that, select your ringtone, and then save the contact at the top and you're done!

Now that you know the procedure for this, do you want to make another dummy contact really quick and assign a ringtone, just so you can call yourself from another phone and confirm it works before you let me go?

Awesome, glad I could help. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

No problem, have a great rest of the day!

","Hi Jamie, I'm Bucky. I'll see if I can't get you sorted out here today. My first suspicion would be that the device just wasn't adequately charging and has now turned off. What was the battery percentage at at when you last checked it?

Oh, it was 95% you say? How interesting, that's the complete opposite of when most people chose to charge their phones. It's almost as if this scenario is super open ended! Well in that case, we might need to attempt to restart your phone. Try holding down the on/off button and the volume down key at the same time. Go ahead and hold that for at least ten seconds.

Great, So that solved your problem? Is there anything else I can do for you today?

It was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your evening!","Hi Timothy, I'm Bucky, and I'd be more than happy to help you with that today. If you open settings, then navigate to 'Accounts & 1words', then 'Add Account', you should see Outlook.com towards the bottom of the list. [if he's wrong and he's using iOS 10 or older, I looks like that's Mail -> Accounts -> Add Account instead]

Right, enter your login credentials there, just like you would on the website.

Yes, it's okay to answer yes to that permission dialog. After you do that, tick all of the services you want to use on, and you should be good to go!

Can you check your mail for me to confirm that it's working?

Awesome! Is there else you needed help with today?

No problem, feel free to reach back out any time you do. Have a great rest of the day!","It seems like you're mostly centered around mobile stuff.. after all you're partnered with Asurion (or are Asurion? That wasn't exactly clear). Either way, it seems like I'd mostly handle requests for basic phone navigation stuff and the occasional bit of basic troubleshooting. That doesn't bug me, and I'm more than happy to help people with simple stuff like that.

I build business phone systems, but the nature of my work means that sometimes I'm slammed and sometimes I have 48 hours of downtime.

I very much like the aspect that you aren't tied down to a specific time window or need to work a certain quota, you're just paid on what you're able to fix.

Also as a side note, I really enjoy document writing and would be willing to contribute to a soluto community-maintained wiki for troubleshooting tips. It seems like your intercom setup is a little barren with mostly marketing info.",0,1,1,80,2,1

Once your iPhone has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational. If it doesn't (or if it won't reboot) we will try something else. 

Please connect your iOS device to its charging cable, plug into an outlet or USB port, and start charging. Let it charge for an hour. If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone and see if it shuts down again. If not, great!!
 If so let’s restore it! Is there anything else I can help you with? Do have any questions or concerns? Have a great day.

Keep holding both buttons down until you see the Apple logo appear on your screen—your screen will go dark first. Do these instructions make sense?
Were there any other issues you needed addressed today?","Hey Timothy, I’m Briana and I’d be happy to help you add your Outlook to your new iPhone! And just so you know, I will walk you through checking your phone software too. Knowing which software you are running on can be hard to tell.
To check your iOS, you’ll go into your phone Settings (the grey, gear-like icon), and you will scroll down to General (again, another gear). You’ll go into the first option, About. Scroll down to Version, and note the number to the right of it. Does it say 11?
Awesome, now we can add your email! This will be in your Settings again. Once you’re back to the first screen in your Settings, scroll down to Mail, Contactd, Calendars. You’ll go to Add Account, and then Outlook.com. Type in your email and 1word and then press Next in the upper right hand corner. Did this sign you in to your account?

"Hi there, let's take a look at changing your contact's specific ringtone. First, swipe up on your home screen to bring up your app menu. Next, look for ""contacts"", which is an orange field with a person's outline on it. After that, find your contact you want to change the ringtone for, tap on their name, and then tap ""details"". It's the option on the far right. 

Once you're on their page, tap ""edit"" up at the top right. There's a downward facing arrow at the bottom right, tap it to bring up more details. Next, you should see a field titled ""Ringtone"". Tap it, and you'll have a list of ringtones to choose from for that person. Once you've made your choice, tap the back button up at the top left, and you're done! You should hear your new ringtone choice whenever that specific person calls you.

Is there anything else that I can help you with today?","Hi, so you're having trouble getting your iPhone 7's screen to come back on while it was charging? I'm sure I can help with that.

It's possible that the phone's software just froze, let's try a hard reset to test it. Hold the home button and the volume down button at the same time, for about 20 seconds. If that worked, you'll see the Apple logo appear on your phone and it will boot up. If not, let's move on.

Do you have another charger and cord to verify that those were working? It's possible that it wasn't charging in the first place. Also try plugging it into a computer to test, as sometimes iPhones will charge on them but not an outlet.

Next, plug your phone into a computer and open iTunes to see if it will detect your phone. Hopefully it will, and we can focus on backing up your data. If it didn't, unfortunately there's not much to be done to recover anything that wasn't backed up.

The last thing to look for is any liquid or physical damage that could have happened to your iPhone that would cause it to not turn on. If you find any liquid, then you need to unplug your phone and stop trying to turn it on. Set your phone in some kind of absorbent material, rice is a common choice, and seal it in a bag for a few hours to try and pull the moisture out, then try powering it on again.

Hopefully these steps were able to get your iPhone's screen to power back on. Is there anything else that I can do to help you today?","Hi! So you're trying to add your outlook email address to your iPhone's email app? We can take care of that right away! 

First, we're going to head into your settings menu. It's the gear-shaped app on your main screen. Next, you're going to look for an option labeled ""accounts & 1words"", it should have a key as its icon. Tap that, then tap ""Add account"".

Pick the outlook.com option, then go ahead and sign in with your address and 1word. It could ask you to give a few permissions to your phone to access the account, if so just go ahead and make sure you're okay with that, then hit accept. 

Next, you're going to have a few options as to what you want syncing with your outlook.com address information. If you just want your email, leave it with just ""mail"" enabled. Otherwise, you can sync your contacts, calendar, reminders, and notes.

Now that we've gotten that taken care of, is there anything else I can help you with today?","Hopefully I'll be helping people with their technical problems.

It sounds to me like the first step may be to force a restart.  To do this hold down the sleep/wake button and the volume down button at the same time.  They are the solo button on the right side of your phone, and the lower of the two buttons in a group on the left side.

After a few seconds, you should see the apple logo.  Keep holding the buttons down until the launch screen comes up.  

Did this resolve your issue?  I may have one alternative if the issue persists.

When you connect your iPhone 7 to a computer, is the device recognized?  

That's good.  Do you have iTunes on this PC/Mac?  Perfect.  This will do a soft restore of your iPhone 7 and should fix the issue you have been having.

Connect your device and open your iTunes.  At the top left, you should see a button that says ""device"".  Click that, and find the button that says ""Back Up Now"".  Depending on how much data was on your phone, the process may take a while.

You will have all your files intact, this process offloads, re-installs, and reloads your data safely.  

Is the backup finished?  Great!  Now click ""restore iPhone"".  This may be another wait, but after this your phone should be working again just fine.

Does your phone turn back on again?  Awesome, glad I could help.  Can I help you with anything else today Jamie?","Hello Timothy, my name is Anthony.  Let's get your outlook.com email added to your iPhone.  

If you are using the ios 11, then let's work through it.  You should have a settings app on your phone  (The icon should be a grey wheel).  Do you see an option called ""Accounts and 1words""?  

Great!  That means you are using ios 11.  Tap that, then you should see a button called ""Add Account"".  

Good so far, now you'll see a few separate icons for different services.  One of those should be outlook.com.  

Awesome!  Now you need to sign in using your outlook.com email and 1word.  From there, you may encounter a few security steps.  If you do, follow the on-screen instructions, which may include checking your outlook.com email from a different device (like your computer) to recognize your iPhone as a trusted device to log in from. 

Okay, now Outlook.com is going to request permissions, but you can customize these at anytime.

If you do already, it may be easier and less complicated to download the Outlook app to keep emails more sorted and separate. You can find this on the App Store if you search Outlook.
Both apps operate the same way from here- if you open either of them up (and select the Outlook option if on the iOS mail app), it will prompt you to enter your email and then your 1word.
Did that work? It should automatically sync with your email from now on. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Awesome we took care of getting your iPhone to turn back on. Sometimes when the device has insufficient charge or the battery is not enough to power it up.  The same thing can happen if your iPhone has completely run out of power. In this case, it could take a bit longer for your device to indicate that it’s charging when you connect it to a charger.
 

if no then I would say... 

Let's se iTunes to enter recovery mode and attempt to re-install iOS.
First let's connect your iPhone to a computer. 
then on your computer open iTunes. Make sure you are using the latest version of iTunes program to prevent possible occurrence of software incompatibility issues.

First: Let me ask if there is enough charge on the phone to power up?

There is, great!  I want you to try to forcibly reboot your phone.  You can do this by holding down the Power and Home button simultaneously until the Apple logo appears. ... The hard reboot solution works if iOS has crashed or is frozen, which can sometimes manifest as an unresponsive iPhone with a black screen that appears dead because it isn't responsive to anything.

If the iPhone did not turn on, try resetting it while connected to the iPhone USB power adapter. To reset, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time for at least ten seconds, until either the Apple logo or the battery symbol appears.

Did the phone turn on for you?  

Awesome, glad to hear that!  Can I help you with anything else?  

No, well then you have a wonderful day.

 ","Hello!  My name is Shonda.  I'll be happy to help you add your outlook.com email to your iPhone.

First let's find out what operating system you have on your phone.  You can do this by doing the following.

Go to the home screen of your iOS device and click on Settings.
Click on General.
Click on About.
Note the number after Version; this is the version of iOS installed on the device.

Great, now that we know what system you have we can add your new outlook email.

1. Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Tap on Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
3. Tap on Add Account.
4. Tap on Outlook.com.
5. Enter your Outlook.com username and 1word and then tap Next in the upper right hand corner.
6. Choose the services you'd like to enable and sync with Outlook and then tap Save in the upper right hand corner.

Were you able to add your outlook email address?

No, okay.  Thank you for contacting us.

You mentioned that you were charging your device at the time when the screen turned off. Do you happen to have a second charger, or a second iPhone around you?

","I think that as an Anywhere Expert, I will be providing excellent technical support to people who don't want to spend all day looking for answers. A lot of people don't have the time or patience to search for troubleshooting steps, and they want to have an effective solution implemented quickly. When they chat with an expert, they want the right answer, and they want it explained in an understandable way versus in overly complicated technical terms. I want to be an Anywhere Expert because I have a lot of experience with providing customer and technical support, and I love helping people. I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I can find a solution to a problem, and even though I have a lot of experience with technology, I also know how to research quickly and find answers when I do not know the solution instinctively.

"assuming I have introduced my self and repeated the question  I would walk the customer through this:  the steps are
From the Home screen, swipe up on an empty spot to open the Apps tray.
Tap Contacts.
Tap the desired Contact name > Details.
Tap EDIT.
Tap More.
Tap Ringtone.
Tap Allow Storage permission > ALLOW.
Tap the desired ringtone to assign it to the contact and then tap OK.
","The 1st thing would be to make sure there is enough charge, let it charge for aprox 30 min.  If that 0s then I might try another cable  or charger. If charging the battery didn't turn your iPhone on, the next thing you should try is to restart the phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off. (P.S. In case you haven't heard, you can now get wireless charging for the iPhone.)

Try a hard reset if the standard restart didn't do the trick. A hard reset is like a restart that clears more of the device's memory (but not its storage. You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 
Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down.)

Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't)
If the shut-down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons
When the white Apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let the phone start up.

There is still a factory reset and DFU mode to discuss, to be thorough, if these previous steps 0ed and I can elaborate if  needed.","again I would greet them and repae t the question to make sure I understood then I would walk the customer through the steps of:

Enter your Outlook.com username and 1word and then tap Next in the upper right hand corner.

There are several ways to do this, we'll try the one I think is the easiest and go from there! Sound good? 
Awesome! Ok, so first do you have the ringtone picked out that you want for the contact? And do you know which contact you are assigning the ringtone to?
Great!

Alright, have you tried pressing the power button, home key or volume buttons to see if that wakes up the phone from sleep mode? If none of these works for you, when you plugged in the phone, was it already dead? Sometimes, when our phone battery is completely drained, it can take a few minutes to get it charged enough to turn on. If it wasn't dead, let's try a few things more to see if we can fix this issue. 
Did any of those things solve your issue? 
Sometimes our phones just need to be reset/restored because of a software crash or there is a hardware problem.
I can walk you through doing a soft reset, which won't disrupt any of your data.
Let's try this: Press & hold the power button on the top right edge until ""slide to power off"" appears on your screen, then release the button. Did that come up on the screen? If yes, then slide the power button to turn off, once off, press and hold the power button again until the Apple logo appears, then release. 
That was a soft reset, let's see if that solved the issue, try turning on your phone. I'll stand by and you can let me know if that worked. If not, we can troubleshoot another way.","Good evening!

Now scroll until you find the specific contact you would like to set the ringtone for and click on their name. Once the contact opens, you should see an icon that looks like a pencil/pen, click on it to edit the contact. A drop down of option should appear; find the one that says ""set ringtone"" or something similar. Now you should see a list of songs/ringtones to choose from. Scroll through the list to find the song you would like to set as the ringtone for the person. Once you have found the song you want, click on it and a box should pop up giving you a list of options. Click the options that says ""set as ringtone"". After you have done that, you can have the contact call to double check to make sure it worked. I hope I was able to help you set the ringtone for your specific contact. Please don't hesitate to contact us again should you have any more questions.

","Hi! My name is Suzanne and I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to tell you a little about myself and why I know this opportunity is exactly what I'm looking for!  

I actually heard about Anywhere Expert from a friend who has nothing but good things to say about this company.  Based on the video and reviews I would be offering technical support on a variety of devices.  Anything from assisting in common questions such as ""how to install this"" or ""I'm having a problem, how do I fix it"".  I would be offering step by step instructions all while providing excellent customer service.  

This best part about this position is that it's all from the convenience of my home or whichever devise I choose to work from.  I'm computer savvy so the technical terms are common to me and I'm a quick study, so areas that I'm unfamiliar with will not be unfamiliar for long.  This is an area where I know I can excel and enjoy working while in my own home office. 

I've worked in customer service at least 15 years and I know treating people with dignity is just as important as being friendly, courteous and knowledgeable.  There are ways to explain things so that you are not making them feel inadequate while using their own devise. 

Thank you for taking the time to go over my answers and I hope to hear positive feedback from you soon!

First thing you will want to do is visit your Contacts List, which can be done by tapping on your green phone icon then selecting Contacts, or by swiping upwards on any empty spot to open the App tray, then selecting Contacts.
Once in your Contacts list, tap on your desired Contact, then select ""details""

From here just select which ringtone you want to use and tap on ""ok"" and you're all done!

Did you have any trouble changing the ringtone? 
I'm glad I was able to help you! Have an awesome night Reggie!
","Good evening Jamie! That's a huge bummer, let's see if we can get your phone to turn back on!

First thing's first; unplug your phone from any charger, and hold down the power button. If it turns on that is great, if not let's try something else.

Have you recently updated your iPhone to the latest iOS? There may be a bug with the newest version related to device power, if that is the case then you may have to speak to Apple Support to get it replaced.

Before we go that far, we can try something else; If you can do me a favor and follow these directions: Hold down the Home button of the phone, then plug your device into your computer. At that point the iTunes logo should appear on your phone (if it does that's great! Your phone should be ok). Soon after, your computer should pop up the iTunes app, and will give you an option to restore the device. Now although this will save your phone, it will wipe everything on it, performing a full restore. If you do not wish to lose any data or contacts, then I would recommend bringing it into an Apple store so they can possibly save it without losing anything. If you do not mind losing any media, then go ahead and choose the full restore.

Did any of the above work?
Was I able to help to your satisfaction?
I am happy I was able to help you save your phone, I always have a mini-heart attack myself whenever my phone starts to act funny, please have an excellent night Jamie!","Good evening Timothy! I can definitely help you with this, it's super simple and quick.

First you'll want to go into your device settings, which can be accessed via the ""settings"" app on the home screen. 
Next scroll down about halfway until you see ""Mail, Contacts, Calendars"". Tap on that.
On the next screen under ""Accounts"" you will see ""Add Account"", select this option and the next screen should have the Outlook.com logo on the bottom.
Choose the Outlook.com logo, and it will then ask for your username and 1word. Enter your Outlook.com credentials then select Next. The next screen will ask you which services you want to Sync, choose whichever services you would like then select Save.

Depending on the size of your inbox, it could take a few minutes for everything to download and sync, but it is totally worth it!

Before we begin I do have a few questions which would help me to resolve your issue. If I may while charging was the phone undergoing an update by chance?

Thank you for that information and if I may what troubleshooting steps have you tried on your own to try and resolve this issue?

Excellent, now one of the things we can try is a force restart of the device sometimes due to varies reasons a force restart is necessary to in a sense jog the device back into order.

Once the Apple logo appears release the buttons.

"Hi Reggie! My name is Samantha and I would love to help you change the ringtone of a specific contact on your Galaxy S8+.

To start, please make sure you are on the home screen of your Galaxy S8+. That means you’ll have to close out of whatever fun application you were just in.

Once there, please find the “contacts” app (its orange with a white outline of a person). You maybe have to open up all of your apps by clicking on the outline of a square button at the bottom of the screen in the middle. 

Great! Now scroll through your contacts and select the person you are trying to add a ringtone for.  Once there select ""Details"" (info sign) and EDIT (Top of screen) then “View more” (Just above ""Scan Business Card"").

That was a lot of information. Let me know when you get there!

Awesome! Please scroll down and you will see “ringtone” click that and “allow permission 1st time” and it will bring up tones for you.

You can now select a ringtone you’d like to assign to your contact. Did this information help you to achieve your goal today?

Great! I’m glad to hear. Thanks for using Anywhere Expert. If there’s anything else we can help you with in the future please come visit us again!","Hi Jamie! My name is Samantha and I hope to help you with your iPhone 7 screen shutting off.

Have you done a manual restart? This is when you hold the home button and the power button at the same time until the phone shuts off. Usually you will see the Apple symbol reappear once the phone is restarted and beginning to load.

Have you tried to charge the phone with a different charging cord? Or test the current cord on another Apple device to see if the cord is functioning correctly? If your battery was low and you plugged it in assuming that it would charge but then the phone died, that would cause the black screen and the inability to turn the phone back on.

That was the case? Great! I’m glad I was able to help resolve your iPhone issues! I hope you find another charging cord that works. I would recommend an Apple quality cord as it will charge your phone faster and it will not break easily.

I will gladly help you with making sure your screen stays on while you are charging your phone.  If your iPhone or iPad keeps shutting down, won't charge, or keeps crashing, it might be time for a hard reset. Whether it's really shutting down on its own, or it's rapidly depleting the battery due to rogue processes or Wi-Fi or cellular radio activity, a hard reset can help.

Once the charging cable's in place, you should see it begin to charge and you'll be able to read the battery level. If it shows little to no charge, it means something drained your battery. If it shows a partially or fully charged battery, you may have another problem.

In either case, connect your iOS device to its charging cable, plug into an outlet or USB port, and start charging. Let it charge for an hour. If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer.

"Hello! My name is Sean, and I'd be happy to help you change the ringtone of a specific contact on your Galaxy s8+. 

First are your contacts backed up on your sim card or to your phone? Contacts located on a sim card can not have the ringtone changed.

To do this you go to ""Contacts"", and then click the menu icon, and then click ""Manage Contacts"", and then click ""Import/Export contacts"". Once you are on the Import/Export contacts screen click ""IMPORT"", and then on the next screen click ""SIM card"", and then click ""All"" at the top of left of your screen to select all contacts and then press ""done"" at the top right, and then select ""Phone"" and press ""IMPORT"" at the bottom. Your contacts are now all saved to your phone and you are ready to proceed.

Now what you want to do is go to ""Phone"", and then ""Contacts"", and then select the person who's ringtone you want changed. Now select ""Details""(info sign), and then ""Edit"", and then ""View more"". Now scroll down and you will see ""ringtone"", click that(allow permission 1st time) and it will bring up ringtones for you and you can set whatever ringtone you like!

You're welcome! Thanks for chatting with us! Please do not hesitate to reach back out to us if you have any further questions. Have a wonderful evening!","Hello! My name is Sean, and I would be happy to help with your iPhone 7 not turning back on.

I understand the importance of your phone not turning on, I have had issues with my phone not turning on before and it is frustrating. Have you tried to restart the iPhone? To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off. If the phone was off, let it turn on. If it was on, restarting it by turning it off and then turning it back on is probably a good idea.

Ok if that didn't work it's no problem. What we are going to do is a hard reset on your phone.

First let me introduce myself.  My name is Stacy Beck and live in Golden Valley, Arizona.  

Based on the questions I answered.  I believe that I will primarily be helping people with Apple products.  More to the point, helping people with basic issues, such as email, minor hardware issues and the like.  Having said that, I also hope to be helping people with other IT related issues as well.  Such as networking, desktop trouble shooting and software issues to hardware problems.

The reason why I want to work for Anywhere Expert is the fact that it can be done, well from anywhere.  (Sorry for the pun.)  At this point in my life I'm a stay at home mom, caring for and schooling my 5 year old son.  I do have a lot of experience with computers and desktop trouble shooting.  Knowledgeable in operating systems from Windows XP - Windows 10, Linux (various) and some experience with Mac.  Went to college, in 2000 - 2002 for an A.A.S. in computer science and have kept up with my skills since.  Also along the years even added some new skills such as domain hosting, website design and graphic design.  So I am also familar with Cpanel, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator & InDesign, Microsoft Office Suite (including OpenSource versions LibreOffice) and some website design programming languages (html, css3 and little PHP).

I truly love helping people solve their IT problems or issues.  My husband jokingly says that my computer is my boyfriend.  Yup I'm a geek and proud of it.  At home I help maintain 2 pc's with Windows 7 & Fedora operating systems, an Android phone and several Android tablets.  But am always looking to sharpen my computer and customer service skills.

Thank you for this opportunity and I truly look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Stacy Beck

"Hi Reggie
From the Home screen, swipe up on an empty spot to open the Apps tray.
Tap Settings.
Tap Sounds and vibration.
Tap Ringtone and select the desired ringtone.
Tap the back arrow in the upper left corner, the selection is automatically saved.","Hi Jamie 
 Force Restart
If your iPhone or iPad keeps shutting down, won't charge, or keeps crashing, it might be time for a hard reset. Whether it's really shutting down on its own, or it's rapidly depleting the battery due to rogue processes or Wi-Fi or cellular radio activity, a hard reset can help.

On an iPhone 7 or newer device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time.
On an iPhone 6s, iPad, or older device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time.
Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears). iOS devices with white faceplates will show a white launch screen. iOS devices with black faceplates will show a black launch screen.
When the launch screen appears, you can let go of the button combo.
Once your iPhone or iPad has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational. If it doesn't (or if it won't reboot) go on to the next step.
2. Plug in
If your iPhone or iPad is rapidly discharging, plug it in. Once the charging cable's in place, you should see it begin to charge and you'll be able to read the battery level. If it shows little to no charge, it means something drained your battery. If it shows a partially or fully charged battery, you may have another problem.

In either case, connect your iOS device to its charging cable, plug into an outlet or USB port, and start charging. Let it charge for an hour. If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone or iPad and see if it shuts down again. If not, great! If so, keep reading.

3. Restore
After trying the easy fixes, it's time to try the harder ones. In this case, restoring your iPhone or iPad in iTunes. iTunes is a safer bet than iCloud because it actually offloads, re-installs, and reloads your data rather than doing everything in-place and on your device.

","I will be helping people trouble shoot their phone, computers, tablets or other devises. This can be as simple as helping set up a new contact, installing a game or changing ringtones, to helping do a factory reset after a backup as part of troubleshooting the device. I always strive for 1-time resolution with a customer. 
You treat a customer like you want to be treated, with politeness and respect, even if you are in a bad mood or they are angry and taking it out on you. 
With a strong customer service background, I think I would be good in this position. Having done troubleshooting for PlayStation in the past, most technology follows the same format for troubleshooting.  
You start by backing EVERYTHING up first, for safety reasons, then you start trouble shooting using the simple things.  If that does not work, you go to the more advanced.  
You always explain to the customer in a way they can understand, and if they do not the first time, rephrase it so they can another way.  
I am self-taught on fixing and troubleshooting, but have no qualms about asking for help if I need it. Or doing the research to find the answers.

","Thank you for this opportunity to become a part of the team at Anywhere Expert.  Based on the questions I answered, I believe I'll be helping people solve basic to complex issues with their iPhones (related products & smart phones), tablets and other such devices.

I was also hoping for the possibility to help others with other technical issues.  Such as LAN, software, general hardware or desktop support also.  Having 10+ years experience (personal and professional) in desktop support and breakfix situations (network printers & LAN). I believe that I would be an excellent fit for your company.  Currently I'm a stay-at-home mom who home schools her 5 year old son.  So having a job like this would be an excellent fit given that and my rural location.

My husband jokingly says that my computer is my boyfriend.  He's not wrong.  I'm a geek at heart.  Computers and helping people, in particular always have been my 1ion.  Though I don't have a degree, I went to Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake, WA (2000 - 2002) for an A.A.S. in Computer Science and since then have kept up with my skills and even added some.

As you can see from my responses, I am very comfortable with online help.  Mentioning my skills earlier in LAN, breakfix situations, hardware repair, & desktop support goes a bit further.  I have experience in various OS systems from Windows XP - Windows 10, Linux and some experience with Mac.  Including smart phones/tablets- Android based & iOS.  At home I help maintain a small network with HP Laptop & PC with Windows 7, my PC with Linux Fedora and several Android tablets and a smart phones.  I even have an old dinosaur computer with Windows 98, that I plan on turning into a media center.

But my skills don't stop at technical support.  While going to college, I studied website design (BBCC & Central Arizona Community College in Coolidge, AZ (2003 - 2004)).  Where I learned desktop publishing and website design learning how to use Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop & InDesign.  Including programming languages like HTML5, CSS3 and some PHP.

My work experience, though greatly varied, includes being a Sales/Marketing Representative & Technician for a Retail company called SOS Survival Gear (2010 - 2014) my husband & I ran.  A brief stint at WalMart, as a Sales Associate, and a Graphic Designer at the Kingman Daily Miner in Kingman, AZ (each in 2015).  Recently, this year, I have gotten back into the tech industry working for companies, such as, RobertHalf, Insight Global and HelloTech as IT Specialist/Breakfix positions.  In between times I have been a housewife and stay-at-home mom.

In closing I look forward to working with Anywhere Expert and look forward to hearing form you soon.  If you have any questions for me please don't hesitate to contact me by calling (928) 219-7345 or mail me.

How to set up and access Microsoft Outlook email on iPhone and iPad

If Microsoft Outlook.com — Live or Hotmail if you're retro — is your mail, contacts, and calendar provider of choice, it's easy to set up and access it right on your iPhone or iPad. Microsoft might have taken a while, and gone through a lot of names and iterations, to get their online consumer services into the modern age, but what they've finally settled on is impressive. There's Exchange if you need ActiveSync. If you don't, there's Outlook.


How to add Outlook mail, calendar, contacts to your iPhone or iPad's Mail app
Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.
Tap on Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
Tap on Add Account.
Tap on Outlook.com.
Enter your Outlook.com username and 1word and then tap Next in the upper right hand corner.
Choose the services you'd like to enable and sync with Outlook and then tap Save in the upper right hand corner.","Well, to be honest with you. The tech job sounds fun.

Have this ever happened before?

Okay, I am glad to hear that this has only happened one time to you. 

Is the charger you are using the original charger that you purchased your iPhone 7 with?

Okay, that is great to hear that you are still using the original charger. Sometimes, when we purchase different Chargers it can be a different voltage and it can imbalance the device but that is great to hear that you are still using the original charger.

How are things looking so far for you Jamie?

That is okay if you are not sure if your phone is still charging while you have switched Outlets.

Since your device is already off I will need you to hold the sleep/wake button and also the volume down button at the same time. After holding for at least more than a few seconds you should see your device come on. Please let me know what happens.

Great news to know that your device restarted. I'm so happy everything worked out for you.

I do have a couple of suggestions, although I am not able to tell you exactly what the problem was or, if it was a big or small problem, but I do suggest that you at least give Apple a call at 1 800 my Apple at your convenience of course.

1- Hold down the Home and on/off buttons to restart the phone.
2- When it restarts, the screen should be working.
3- Tap the Settings app.
4- Tap General.
5- Tap Reset.
6- Tap Reset All Settings. This erases all your preferences and settings on the iPhone, but won't delete your data

Also , If this is not what the customer did I would tell the customer to press and hold the Side and Volume down button for at least 10 seconds or until the Apple logo appears. I would then ask them if that didn’t work, to charge IPhone up for at least an hour until the battery percentage shows up.

Are you connected to Wifi, we will need it to download the application and check your mail.
'
1st lets open the itunes app store. It is a blue button with a triangle made of white sticks.

If you have not already, it will require you to register for the store. You can add a card at this time but if you scroll down you can skip and get the free apps.

Find the search button that looks like a small magnifying glass and touch this icon. Now type in Microsoft Outlook email and select the one that has the author Microsoft Corporation. Touch install and wait for it to download and install.

Open your new app that has appeared on the last page swiping on your phone that is a blue button with a letter in it. You will then see a page with different icons from various email companies, choose outlook.com which looks the same as the icon for the program. Add your username (don't need outlook.com part) and 1word; same as you use when checking it online.

So, you getting emails or error messages?

You need help with anything else?

Have a good evening and lets chat if you have any more problems.

"Hello! I'm Mohamed, and I would be happy to help you change your ringtone for a specific contact. From the home screen of your phone, could you please swipe up anywhere  empty on the screen to open up the Apps tray? 

Awesome. Now, do you see an icon labeled ""Phone"" or ""Contacts"". In the case you see ""Phone"" tap on it and look for an icon labeled ""Contacts"". 

Great! Now from your contacts, select the desired contact you wish to set a custom ringtone for. Alright, you're almost there! Please select ""Details"" from this screen (looks like a small letter I). Amazing, now please select ""EDIT"" from the top of the screen. 

Wonderful, only a couple of steps left before you get your custom ringtone! Could you please scroll down on your screen until you see a ""View More"" icon (Just above ""Scan Business Card""). 

Select the ""View More"" icon, and from this screen is where you can change your ringtone. Scroll down and tap ringtone (allow permission for the first time), and it will bring up ringtones for you! Tap the desired the contact and ,you guessed it, then tap ""OK"". The selection is automatically saved!

Just to make sure it worked, could you mind asking the contact to, I know it's ironic, to contact you in order make sure our efforts weren't for naught. Great!

This process should work for anytime you want to change your specific contact ringtone. Does this resolve all of your concerns today? 

You’re welcome. Thanks for chatting with us! Please do not hesitate to reach back out to us if you have any further questions. Don’t forget to rate us after your experience.

","Hey! I'm Mohamed, and I'd be more than happy to assist you with your screen shutting off. 

I totally understand your issue, this happened to me not too long ago lol. Let's make sure you don't have this issue any more, and trust me, it's an easy fix.

What we're going to do is simply forcibly restart your iPhone, so it starts working again. All you're going to do is press and HOLD the ""VOLUME DOWN"" button and ""POWER"" button. The power button is located on the ride of the iPhone and the Volume Down button is located on the left side of the phone, the bottom button as the name implies.

Great, now KEEP HOLDING until you see the Apple Logo appear. Once you see the logo, the phone should have successfully restarted! 

Now, before I go, let's make sure everything is working normally. Can you still charge your phone? Is your phone working as intended? Awesome!

 You’re welcome! Does this resolve all of your concerns today?

Thank you for chatting with us. I hope you have a wonderful day, and please reach out if you need any further assistance!



","Hi! I'm Mohamed, and I'd be happy to assist you with adding your outlook email to your iPhone. I myself actually had some trouble not too long ago, but I found out it's a pretty easy task that I can definitely help you with.

First off, from your home screen on your phone, could you please go to the ""Settings"" app? It is an icon that looks like a gray gear wheel.

Great! From here, could you scroll down the list and tap on ""Accounts and 1words""? It looks almost like a key.

If you look under ""Accounts"" you will see an option called ""Add Account"" Could you please tap on ""Add Account""?

Awesome. Now from here you're going to want to select that type of email you want to add. You say you want to add an ""outlook"" email, so please tap on the ""outlook"" icon. 

After doing so, you're going to want to follow the on-screen instructions from outlook. Basically, just sign in to your outlook account with the email you want to add. 

Once you've signed in, select ""YES"" when asked to give iOS permission to access your email. This is so that iOS can sign into your account without having to put your email and 1word in every time. Handy right!

Wonderful. Now, a screen will pop up which tells you which ""apps"" iOS will sync up with your outlook email such as Reminders, Calendars, and Notes. After selecting which apps you want to sync with your email, tap on ""Save"" to finish up! Easy right! 

Now the ""Mail"" app will have access to your outlook email and you can check your email by simply going to the ""Mail"" app from the home screen, and selecting the Outlook mailbox. 

If you ever want to revisit your email account's app permission setting to make changes, you can edit your selection anytime by simply heading to ""Accounts & 1words"" option within the Settings app and tapping on your email account to access its settings page, just like we did before!

You're welcome. Does that resolve all of your concerns today?

It was my pleasure. Thank you for chatting with us. I hope you have a wonderful day, and please reach out if you need any further assistance!

"Hello Reggie! My name is Laci and I am here to help you in the best way possible. Give me one moment to give you all the steps in helping you today,
From the Home screen, swipe up on an empty spot to open the Apps tray.
Tap Contacts.
Tap the desired Contact name > Details.
Tap EDIT.
Tap More.
Tap Ringtone.
Tap Allow Storage permission > ALLOW.
Tap the desired ringtone to assign it to the contact and then tap OK.
Tap the back arrow in the upper left corner, the selection is automatically saved.
If you have any more problems or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us again to help. Have a wonderful day!","Hello Jamie, My name is Laci and I will be happy to help you today with your issue. There is a few things we can try out to fix this issue. The first thing we can try is a force restart. Do you have your device in front of you? Awesome! Locate and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time. Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears). iOS devices with white faceplates will show a white launch screen. iOS devices with black faceplates will show a black launch screen.
When the launch screen appears, you can let go of the button combo.
Once your iPhone has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational. If it doesn't (or if it won't reboot) we can go to the next step to try.

The next step to try is to plug it in. Once the charging cable's in place, you should see it begin to charge and you'll be able to read the battery level. If it shows little to no charge, it means something drained your battery. If it shows a partially or fully charged battery, you may have another problem.

In either case, connect your iOS device to its charging cable, plug into an outlet or USB port, and start charging. Let it charge for an hour. If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone and see if it shuts down again. If not, great! If so, Try the next step.

After trying the easy fixes, it's time to try the harder ones. In this case, restoring your iPhone in iTunes. iTunes is a safer bet than iCloud because it actually offloads, re-installs, and reloads your data rather than doing everything in-place and on your device. That can sometimes shake loose bad bits that even a hard reset or iCloud restore can't.

Connect your iOS device to iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC using your device's charging cable.
Click on the Device button at the top left.
Click on Back Up Now.
Wait for the backup to finish.
Click on Restore iPhone… (or whatever iOS device you've connected).
Wait for the restore to finish. When you're all done, see if your iPhone or iPad stays on. If so, hallelujah! If not, there's one more thing to try.

Sometimes a problem really is a problem. Like any electronic device, batteries can 0 and circuits can short. If you have AppleCare+, don't walk, run to get it fixed. If you don't, get an estimate and weigh the cost of repair against the cost of upgrading to a new device.

If you don't live close to an Apple Store, you can call 1-800-MY-APPLE in order to set up a mail-in repair. If you don't have AppleCare, you may have to pay for the call, but it's less of a waste than having a dead iPhone.

If you have anymore questions or need any help please don't hesitate to contact us again. It was a pleasure helping you fix your problem and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!","Hello Timothy, My name is Laci and I will be helping you solve your issue today.

Once you do that you will scroll until you see ringtone and click on that and your ringtones should generate. ,I am so sorry to hear that. I hate when my phone cuts off. You should unplug and plug it back up and wait about 5mins. It usually does that when the phone is really dead. I’ll wait and you can let me know if that works out.,I can assist you with adding your email! Are you trying to set it up with iCloud or you need the outlook app ? ,With anywhere expert I look forward to helping resolve customers issues and help with any questions they may have.

Ok great, it is for an existing contact! I'll walk you through each step by letting you know what to click on and what you should see on the screen.

It sounds like you were charging your iPhone 7, the screen shut off and now it will not come back on, is this correct? What type of iPhone 7 do you have , is it the 7 or 7 plus? Ok great thank you for that information.
First, let's check the power cord and power source. This way we can make sure that everything is plugged in firmly and not damaged.  
Great thanks, it seems that the power cord and power source are not the source of the issue.
Approximately how much battery power did the device have prior to attempting to charge it?  I also have an iPhone 7 and once it reaches below 25% battery life, it will provide a warning notification then shut down and will not turn on until there is a sufficient amount of battery power after charging.
Let's take a few steps to get your phone to power on. If the phone is still plugged into the charger, please remove it now. 
Press and hold both the side and volume down buttons for a minimum of 10 seconds, or until you see the Apple logo.
If you see the Apple logo, then the phone is turning itself back on. Did you see the apple logo? 
Great!  The phone is turning back on, sounds like it may have just been very low on power and conserving energy.  Once the phone starts back up, the apple logo will disappear and your wallpaper or code screen will pop up. 
You may want to check your batter power meter, to ensure it does or does not need further charging. Look in the top right corner of the phone and check the battery meter and it will display the current percentage of power left in the phone's batter. Depending on the result, you may want to continue charging the phone.

As a kid my mom never really had the money to buy me the newest iPods,iPhones, laptops, playstation, Xboxes, etc so I use to spend hours reading their descriptions online, and watching reviews/unboxings, Q/A etc. I feel like all of that knowledge that I amassed will help me when I am asked to help others. I also feel like I wouldn't rush or do too much for the customer, when dealing with a tech problem people are usually angry and want their problem done quickly as possible. And that is what I am planning to do, have peoples problems fixed quickly as possible and have them leaving the Anywhere Expert platform with a smile on their face.

Sounds like you are having a issue with your iPhone today. Lets see if we can't get this device back up running for you today. 
So to make sure I understand correctly the device was charging then turned off, and now will not power back on? 
Is that correct? 

Ok, I just have a few questions for you Jamie. 
Has this ever happened before?
How much of a charge was on the device before it shut off? 

What kind of charger are you using? Apple Brand or 3rd Party? 
If you are using a 3rd party cable it can sometimes cause the device to not charge fully. If you have an Apple branded one lets plug it up and give its a few couple of minutes and see if we get any pictures on the screen. 

Have you noticed the device charging slowly as of late? Jamie if the battery is performing slowly you can call Apple Care, and have them run a diagnostics on the Battery to see if it is possible 0ing, and needs replacing. 

Is there any liquid or damage to the device? 
If the device has any liquid damage I would suggest trying to see if you have Apple Care or any Issuance on the device. 

Do you have a back up of your information? 
If we have a good back up I would love to see if we can restore the device via iTunes.  If you have a good back up lets go ahead, and head to your computer and grab the Apple Cable, and your device. 
Go ahead and plug in just the cable in your computer(Make sure the iPhone is disconnected). Now lets open up iTunes. 
Hold down the Home button, and plug up the Cable into the iPhone now, and keep holding down until you see the Cable and iTunes symbol on the front of the iPhone Screen. 
This should prompt you to Restore the device Jamie. 

Did this help to answer your questions Jamie? 
Well just Glad I was able to help. Hopefully this doesn't happen to you again, but if you do run into any trouble you know where to reach us.

Just as an added suggestion, try plugging the device in using the wall adapter to another outlet in your home/office to see if it still appears to be charging or if the same issue occurs.

"Hi goodmorning i am shweta, i will walk you through the process of changing the ringtone for a specific contact..

Go to the People app (also may be labelled Contacts) and select a contact.
In contact details, hit the Menu button (three vertical dots in the top-right corner) and choose Edit (this step may be unnecessary on your phone)
Scroll down until you see Ringtone. Tap it and select a tone to play when they call.

I hope i was able to help you change the ringtone, is there anything else i can assist you with?

Thank you have a great day.","Hi i am Shweta i will help you with different method to start your iphone, i will walk through it step by step let me know when it works.

Hard Reset the iPhone
Try a hard reset if the standard restart didn't do the trick. A hard reset is like a restart that clears more of the device's memory (but not its storage. You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 

Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down.)

Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't)
If the shut-down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons
When the white Apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let the phone start up.

i will be waiting till the time your phone starts back on, let me know i am right here.

(after 30 seconds) did it work? awesome i hope i resolved your phone issue, is there anything else i can assist you with..","Hi i am Shweta, i assume that you are using the latest version ios 11 and your new phone.

Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi.
Tap Settings > General > Software Update.( Setting is the grey icon on your iphone) if you see IOS 11 updated then, 

You might not be able to send email with an Outlook.com, Office 365, or Exchange account until you update to iOS 11.0.1.

If your email account is hosted by Microsoft on Outlook.com or Office 365, or an Exchange Server 2016 running on Windows Server 2016, you might see this error message when you try to send an email with iOS 11: ""Cannot Send Mail. The message was rejected by the server.""

wait for the latest update of IOS 11.0.1. and than you can set up your Outlook.com e-mail.

Ok thank you for that bit of information, I want to make sure I'm walking you through this process correctly.

","Hello Jamie, my name is Stephen and I'm so sorry that you have to take time out to deal with your iPhone 7's screen not turning back on. I would be to assist you with getting your device to work properly again. 

I'd like to ask you a few questions first if that's ok so I can help resolve this issue as quickly as possible.

(Allow customer to respond)

Thank you. Jamie my first question is has your iPhone screen shut off recently or maybe has a history of performing this way?

(Allow customer to answer. For this example I will say the phone has done this once before but just fixed itself seemingly)

Thank you for that answer, that definitely helps me get a better idea of what the issue may be. One more question for you Jamie; how often do you reboot your iPhone?

(Allow the customer to answer. For this example I will say the phone has never been rebooted)

Ok, I've definitely got a better grasp of what is going on with your device. I appreciate all the information you've been able to provide me, thank you!

At this time Jamie I'd like to walk you through a reboot of your iPhone. With many devices, especially cell phones, we can tend to overlook that they need to be rebooted like other electronic devices and I'm confident the reboot I'm going to walk you through will restore your device back to normal.

With your device unplugged from the charger, I'd like you to find both the volume down button on the left side of your iPhone and the home button on the front bottom of your phone. Once you've got both buttons identified please let me know.

(Allow customer to respond)

Great! If you would please press and hold both volume down and the home button simultaneously for me until you see the Apple logo on your screen. Once you see the Apple logo please release both the buttons we pressed. Please let me know when you see the Apple logo

(Allow the customer to press the buttons and see the Apple logo)

Awesome! Now that the Apple logo is on the screen your iPhone is going through its start up process. In a moment you should see your home screen and it will allow you to unlock your device and access everything on the device. Once you have the phone unlocked let me know and we'll test the device to make sure it's working properly.

(Allow the customer to unlock the device)

You're doing great Jamie. Now that we've gotten your device to turn back on, I'd like us to walk through using the device as you normally would to make sure everything is working properly. Please take a moment to click on any applications you like and make sure they open. Also, let's connect your charger back to the phone to make sure this issue doesn't occur again.

(Let the customer check the device for about 45 seconds to a minute)

I'm so happy that everything is working properly for your now Jamie. To help keep your phone running as smoothly as possible I'd recommend rebooting your device on a weekly basis if you can remember. I personally set a calendar reminder for myself to do reboot my own phone so that I can keep it running as smooth as possible.

(Allow customer to respond)

Outside of getting your iPhone 7 to become responsive again is there anything else that I can assist you with today Jamie?

(Allow customer to respond. For this example I will say no more assistance is needed)

Ok. Thank you for allowing me the chance to assist you with your phone issue today. Please remember if you have any more issues in the future to reach out to us for assistance as we're happy to help resolve your device issues.

Have a great day!","Hi Timothy! My name is Stephen and it would be my pleasure to help you add Outlook.com to your iPhone device. I'll definitely be able to assist you with adding your email and showing you which version of iOS you have.

(Allow customer to respond)

Ok Timothy let's start by identifying which version of iOS your iPhone is currently running. On your phone I'd like you to find and select your ""Settings"" icon; the icon itself will look like a grey gear. Once you've located settings please tap the icon to open the menu and let me know when you're in settings.

(Allow customer to respond)

Great! On the left side of our screen I'd like you to scroll the screen until you find an option that says ""General"". When you find that option please tap it and then search for the word ""About"". When you see ""About"" please tap that selection and let me know what you see on your screen now.

(Allow customer to respond)

Cool. Timothy if you could please, on your screen do you see anything that says ""Version"" and has some numbers to the right of it?

(Allow customer to respond. For this example the customer does have iOS 11)

Awesome! So now we've determined that your phone is indeed running iOS 11. Now that we've determined which iOS your running let's work together to get your Outlook email added to your device. If you could, in the upper left corner of your phone, please click the back arrow to go back 1 screen.

Now that we've gone back a screen, on the left side of your phone's screen again, I'd like you to please scroll until you see the ""Mail, Contacts and Calendars"" option. Once you locate that option, please select it by tapping on your screen and letting me know what you see on your device next.

(Allow customer to answer)

Great! We're almost done at this point Timothy thank you for being so patient.

Before we look to add the Outlook account would you be able to tell me Timothy if you're connected to a WIFI source right now or are we using your phones data connection?

(Allow customer to answer. For this example we will say WIFI)

Thank you. I want to make sure we don't run over any possible data limits your phones plan may have once we add this Outlook account to your device.

At this point I'd like you to locate and select ""Add account"" on the left side of your screen. Once you've tapped that selection with your fingers you should now see an option labeled Outlook. Do you see that option at this point?

(Allow customer to answer. For this example we will answer yes they see the option)

Cool! Please tap on Outlook and let's walk through entering your username and 1word to get the account synced to your iPhone.

(Allow customer to enter information)

Ok Timothy with your login information now entered please click the ""Next"" option with your fingers and select what services you'd like to enable and sync with your device. Remember there's no right or wrong answers with this selection, this is just whatever fits your needs best.

(Allow customer to make sync selections)

Alright now that we've made your selections I'd like you to please select the save option located in the upper right hand corner of your screen to save our work. The only step we have now is wait for your emails to start coming in. This part may take some time as the rate in which your emails are transferred to your phone will depend on not only your phones WIFI connection but your email server as well. So that we know this account was established correctly I'd like to wait until you get a few emails in your inbox first, would that be ok?

(Allow customer to answer. For this example we will say the customer wants to make sure emails are incoming)

Awesome! I'm glad I was able to assist you with finding your iOS version and add your Outlook email to your iPhone today Timothy. Is there anything else that I can assist you with today?

(Allow customer to answer)

Thank you so much for allowing me to assist you today. Please don't hesitate to contact us again if you need assistance with your iPhone.

I'm Melissa. I will help you get your iPhone 7 back up and running.
First of all, do you have your phone with you? Excellent!
Do you see your sleep/wake button? We're going to hold that button and the down volume button down at the same time. Keep them pressed and look at your screen. Your screen should go blank, and then show you the Apple logo.
Did you see the blank screen followed by the apple?
Great! Now I'll stay with you for a little bit to make sure the phone is working and staying on. 
Still on? Great. Can you tell me what the battery level is?
I recommend you put the phone on a charger until it's fully charged. Do you have a different charger than you used last time? It may be the charger you used before is not good any more.
Is the phone still on? Fantastic.  
If you have a problem again, please contact us , because there are other steps we can take to fix the problem if it persists.
 Is there anything else I can assist with? No? I'm glad I was able to help.

Try a hard reset if the standard restart didn't do the trick. A hard reset is like a restart that clears more of the device's memory (but not its storage. You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 
1. Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down.)
 2. Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't)
3. If the shut-down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons
4. When the white Apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let the phone start up.

1. Force Restart
  If your iPhone or iPad keeps shutting down, won't charge, or keeps crashing, it might be time for a hard reset. Whether it's really shutting down on its own, or it's rapidly depleting the battery due to rogue processes or Wi-Fi or cellular radio activity, a hard reset can help.

  On an iPhone 7 or newer device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time.

  Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears). iOS devices with white faceplates will show a white launch screen. iOS devices with black faceplates will show a black launch screen.

  When the launch screen appears, you can let go of the button combo.

  Once your iPhone or iPad has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational. If it doesn't (or if it won't reboot), please follow further instruction.

2. Plug in
  If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone or iPad and see if it shuts down again. If not, great! If so, please follow further instructions.

3. Restore
After trying the easy fixes, it's time to try the harder ones. In this case, restoring your iPhone or iPad in iTunes. iTunes is a safer bet than iCloud because it actually offloads, re-installs, and reloads your data rather than doing everything in-place and on your device. That can sometimes shake loose bad bits that even a hard reset or iCloud restore can't.

  Connect your iOS device to iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC using your device's charging cable.

  Click on the Device button at the top left.

  Click on Back Up Now.

  Wait for the backup to finish.

  Click on Restore iPhone… (or whatever iOS device you've connected).
  
  Wait for the restore to finish.

And scroll down to settings. Now this is within your contact so it’s a different settings. Once you click settings it should bring up ringtones/notifications and you can change it. ","Hello my names Palynn and I’d be happy to help you find a solution to fixing your iPhone. 

I have a few tips here. On an iPhone 7 or newer device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time. ...
Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears).iOS devices with white faceplates will show a white launch screen. iOS devices with black faceplates will show a black launch screen.
When the launch screen appears, you can let go of the button combo.
Once your iPhone or iPad has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational. If it doesn't (or if it won't reboot) go on to the next step.

This next step is the process of restoring. 

After trying the easy fixes, it's time to try the harder ones. In this case, restoring your iPhone or iPad in iTunes. iTunes is a safer bet than iCloud because it actually offloads, re-installs, and reloads your data rather than doing everything in-place and on your device. That can sometimes shake loose bad bits that even a hard reset or iCloud restore can't.

Connect your iOS device to iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC using your device's charging cable.
Click on the Device button at the top left.
Click on Back Up Now.
Wait for the backup to finish.
Click on Restore iPhone… (or whatever iOS device you've connected).

To start, I'd like to ask you a few general questions to see if we can narrow down what could possibly have caused this issue. Do you happen to know what your battery was at when you plugged the phone into the charger?
Are you charging it at the usual place that you charge the device or is it a different location or outlet?
Have you tried using the charger on a different outlet to see if it is possibly that it is not getting any power?
If you try holding down the sleep/wake button does the phone try to boot up and just shut back down?
(If issue is not caused by lack of charge on battery)
What we can do now is try to perform what is called a force restart. What we are going to do is hold down the sleep/wake button and the volume down button. The sleep/wake button will be on the right side of your device when you are looking at it's screen. The volume down will be the lower button on the left side of your device when looking at the screen.
Now continue holding those buttons down and you should see the apple logo appear on the screen, continue holding the buttons until the launch screen appears. Then you can release the buttons.

Before we begin, I just have a couple of questions to ask. Has this happened to you before? or Did you drop your phone in water? 
 
Thank you for that information. If the iPhone is frozen and can't be restarted in the normal way do the following: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. If the red slider appears or the screen dims, keep pressing the two buttons until the Apple logo appears. 
 
A black screen is usually caused by a hardware problem with your iPhone, so there usually isn't a quick fix. ... On the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you perform a hard reset by pressing and holding the volume down button and the power button at the same time until the you see the Apple logo appear on the screen. 
 
Unless you are absolutely certain that there is plenty of charge left on the battery, connect the phone to a wall charger for at least 15 minutes. If it was just a low battery the phone will come on by itself. If it doesn't go to step 2. Hold the HOME and POWER (aka SLEEP) at the same time. 
 
Great, once you have done that, you can then release both keys and wait until the device reboots completely and turns back on. 
 
I will standby to make sure this has worked. If not, we can proceed to try something else.  
 
Perfect. Can you make sure your device functions as normally?

Fantastic, Was I able to resolve your all of your issues today? 
 
You are very welcome. Thank you for chatting with us. If you have any other issues with your iPhone, please do not hesitate to contact us. Have a wonderful day! ","1) Control Over Your Schedule: 
Being in charge of your day is one of the biggest pros of working from home. 
 
 
You can set and customize your work hours to meet the needs of your personal and family life. Do you wish you could take a power nap in the middle of the day? You can as a home business owner. Do you do your best work late at night, you can schedule your work time then. 
 
But, with this new-found freedom, come distracting temptations and the risk of procrastinating on work-related tasks. You'll want to make sure you have the right entrepreneurial character traits to handle this new responsibility. 
 
2) More Time for Parenting and Personal Pursuits: 
If you feel like your job is taking up too much time, having a home business could be the solution. Having a flexible schedule means you can make time for your kids and family, or pursue other interests. If you want to home school while running your business, you can. 
 
However, achieving work/life balance does take some planning and time management. In some cases, you may still need to arrange for childcare. 
 
  
 
3) Make Money Doing Something You Love: 
One of the best aspects of starting a home business is being able to turn a hobby or a 1ion into income. In fact, you're more likely to achieve success if you focus on pursuing your 1ion over profits when starting a home business. 
 
4) No More Commuting or High Gas Bills: 
Americans spend an average of $386 per month on gas. 
 
 
Cutting down on a daily commute would put some of that money back in your pocket. Along with money, you'll save time normally wasted commuting.  
 
5) Control Over Income: 
Many people choose not to start a business because they worry about making a consistent, livable income. While this is something home business owners need to consider, the reality is that a home business can allow you to earn what you're worth, and more than a job. As a home business owner, you set your income goals, and your product or service prices. As long as you do the work that needs to be done, such as drumming up new customers and marketing your business you'll make a profit.  
 
6) Tax Benefits: 
A big perk of working for yourself, are the tax advantages not given to employees. You can write off equipment, supplies and even a portion of your home or car, if it is appropriate. Some of these expenses you currently have, but don't get a deduction for, such as Internet. Further, whereas in a job, you pay taxes on your total earning, in a home business, you can deduct your expenses first, and pay taxes on net income. With that said, it's important to learn about home business deductions to insure you're following proper tax laws. Ideally you should consult a tax expert. 
 
 
7) Control Over Your Work Attire: 
No more blazers and dress pants. No more ties or pantyhose. You can wear whatever you want in your home office. If you're most comfortable and inspired in your fluffy bathrobe, you can wear it every day if you want. One note of caution though, work attire has been shown to correlate with productivity levels. So, just because you can wear your jammies, doesn’t always mean you should. You may find a business casual environment in your home office helps you get more done during the day. 
 
8) No Boss: 
A home business is ideal for someone who doesn't like to be told what to do, you has ideas about how to do something better. Further, home business owners don't have feel guilty for showing up late (unless of course it's to an appointment). There's no having to ask for time off or calling in sick. 
 
There's no one looking over your shoulder to make sure you're working. 
 
9) Greater Levels of Satisfaction: 
There is a direct link between personal satisfaction and happiness. When you are doing what you love and/or achieving success at it, you are destined to be happier. This happiness and satisfaction will permeate all areas of your life. You will be more pleasant to be around, you will exhibit greater patience, and those who are happier, live longer. 
 
10) Learning new skills and growing professionally: 
Too often, employees end up feeling stuck in their jobs; their lives filled with the same things every day. In a home business, even if you're day-to-day is relatively similar, there are so many opportunities to mix things up. Starting a business in and of itself requires learning new things. To stay competitive, you'll want to continue study and keep abreast of current trends in your industry or small business management. I essence, you design your day and what you do, which allows you to expand and grow your skills and your business. ",0,1,0,,1,0

"I can definitely walk you through the process of making a specific contact ring tone! First, we will want to find your contact icon. It looks like a silhouette of a person. It may be on your home page, or in your ap list. Once you're in your contact list, you will want to scroll down, or search for the specific contact you would like to set the ring tone for. Tap the contact, and select options. That will lead you to the edit ""button"". Then, you will scroll down to select the ringtone, and you'll want to tap defaults. From there you will be given three different options. The options will be default, ringtone, and go to my files. Default is if you want to use the devices pre installed sounds, ringtone would be pre installed ring tones, and if you go to my files, you can choose from the songs and music that are saved on your device. Once you have made your choice, you will want to tap ""okay"". Then, you're all set! You can tap your home button to return to your home screen! Today you chatted to get instructions on how to set a specific contact ring tone. We walked through the process of setting individual ring tones. Do you feel I have resolved the issue you chatted for today? ","I am very happy to assist you with your iphone7. I would ask the customer what they see? What they were doing when the screen when off? If the device is still charging? If they see any kind of light, or indicator that the phone has any type of power. After all the probing questions, if we assumed the screen was just black or frozen, I would walk the customer through force restarting their device by pressing and holding both the power and volume down buttons for at least 10 seconds until they saw an apple logo. If the device still did not power up, the customer would need to plug in the power cord after checking with different cords different sockets making sure there is no debris. If it still will not power on or they are at least unable to see the charging screen we would move on to next steps including connecting to iTunes and going into recovery mode trying to update. There are many different ways to troubleshoot devices. The route you go depends on how your customer answers probing questions.","Ask probing questions to see what version of iPhone he has. Then, ask him to go to settings ap that looks like a grey cog, then to scroll to general, and then tap about to find what iOS the device is running. Once I find out the device is up to date, or we update the device, we would back to the first screen of settings, and I would guide the customer to tap on mail, contacts, calendars. Then, we would tap add account. We would then tap on outlook.com. I would then guide the customer to log in with their outlook user name and 1word and then tap next in the upper right hand corner. Once logged in, we would choose the services the customer would like to enable and sync with outlook. Once the customer has their chosen services enabled, I would guide them to tap save in the upper right hand corner. Customer is done.

I am sorry to hear you are having trouble with getting your iPhone 7 to turn on. I am sure that is frustrating. I would love to help you resolve this issue.
First, I would like to ask you a few questions. Was the phone actively charging when it shut off? You will know if the phone was charging if there was a lightning bolt beside the battery icon in the status bar, or there was a large battery icon on your lock screen.
If it was not actively charging, the battery likely died. We will want to check for issues with your charger cable or the charging port on your iPhone. 
If the phone was actively charging when it shut off, I would like you to try something.

"Hello there, Reggie.  My name is Dan and I'll be helping you today.  

What version of the Android Operating System is running on your Galaxy S8+?  It's okay if you don't know - I can guide you to the settings where it will show us.

Great, thanks!  Let's go into the Settings and find Ringtones.

Awesome; now we'll change the sub-setting related to specific contacts.

Do you see the contact on the list that you'd like to change?

Wonderful; please select that contact and pick the ringtone you'd like to have.

Now, let's test it out.  Please go back to your home screen and I'll guide you back to the Settings to ensure that our change was saved.  

Perfect; does that solve your problem?

Glad to help; hope you have a great day!","Hi Jamie, my name is Dan and I'll be assisting you today.

Can you please tell me more about the issue and exactly what happened?

Thanks, that is helpful.  

Let's try resetting the phone first.  Please press down the power button for about 5 seconds.  Did anything happen?

If it turned back on, that's great.  If not, let's try plugging it back into the electrical outlet.  Did you notice anything appear on the screen?  If yes, let's try powering it back on by pushing the power button for five seconds.  If the screen is still blank, let's try one more thing.

First, unplug your iPhone.  Do you see a small hole on the side of the iPhone?  Please find a paperclip and bend it so that you have a straight end.  Gently press this into the hold until the compartment ""pops"" out.  Be careful, and make sure you're not over a sink drain or any other holes.  Pull out the ""sim card,"" it's a very small microchip and you'll need to handle it carefully.  Blow on it to make sure there's no dust on it, and put it back inside the compartment.  Now, push the compartment closed.  Now that it's closed, try to power on the phone.  If that does not work, plug the phone back in, and again try to power on the phone.  Did that work?

I am sorry to hear this is not working.  We've tried all of the troubleshooting steps.  You'll need to contact your mobile phone company or Apple to seek additional support.  There may be problems with the actual phone itself.  It is possible that your warranty may cover it depending on how long you've owned your phone.  

Do you have any questions about finding the contact information for Apple or your mobile phone company?

Ok, I am sorry we couldn't fix your problem, but at least we eliminated certain possibilities and this should save you time when you call Apple or your mobile phone provider.  

Hope you have a good day and good luck with the next steps. ","Hi Timothy, my name is Dan and I will be assisting you today. 

Let's first check what iOS you have on your phone.  Please go to the Settings, and select General.  Then, go to the Operating System option to see what it says.  

Thanks, that's helpful. 

Please go back to your Settings, and then select Mail.  Once you've selected Mail, then select Accounts. From here, please select Add Account.  Then, pick the graphic that shows Outlook.com.  

Once you're selected Outlook.com, the menu will prompt you for the Sign In credentials, like your e-mail and 1words.  Please do not share these with me, but go ahead and follow the instructions on your phone as it guides you through the steps.

Have you finished the steps?  Did that work for you?  

Excellent!  Please go to your inbox and see if your Outlook.com e-mail is loaded into your inbox.

Locate the power button on the upper right side of your iPhone. Press and hold the button down until you see the Apple logo pop up on the screen.

Nothing happened? That's ok, we have another option to try. 

Try holding down the same power button on the upper right side along with the volume down button on the left (it's the bottom of the two small circular buttons) for 10 seconds. Be sure to hold them down at the same time. 

Did the Apple logo appear on the screen?

Great! I'm so glad we could get your iPhone started back up. Is that all you needed help with tonight? 

Awesome! Come back if you have any other questions or issues. Have a great night!","Hello Timothy, my name is Chris. I'm happy to help you get your Outlook.com email setup on your iPhone!

First, let's confirm you have the latest Apple iOS. Please find and tap on the Settings app. It has a gray icon with a gear inside.

Great! Now scroll down and tap on General. Near the bottom of the screen it should say Version followed by a series of numbers that look like 10.1.2 or 11.3.1. Do you mind telling me what it says?

Perfect! You are on the latest operating system update from Apple. Now tap General on the top left, and then Settings on the top left. 

Scroll down to Accounts and 1words and tap on it.

"Hello Reggie! My name is Andrew and I would be happy to help you change your ringtone for a specific contact on your Galaxy S8+. 
From the home screen, go ahead and swipe up to display all the apps within the phone. After you have done that, look for contacts and lets click in there. 
In the Contacts list, go ahead and find the specific contact you would like to change the ringtone for and tap on that contact and then tap on the options menu that will pop up. 
Click on the ""edit"" button, and then scroll down to the ringtone section. 
From there, it will give you options to keep the ringtone on the default sound, as well as the option to select a custom song or sound to replace this default sound. 
After you have selected your preferred sound, go ahead and confirm your choice by tapping ""Ok"" and then press the home button in order to take you back to the home screen. 
You may want to test out the ringtone with a contact to ensure that the setting of the ringtone for the specific contact was indeed changed.
Did this solve all your issues that you had today? Is there anything else in which I can assist you with?","Hi Jamie! My name is Andrew. That is unfortunate, but I will do all I can to help you get your iPhone 7 back up and running. 
Let's go ahead and start some basic troubleshooting first, that way we can rule out some things and get to the bottom of this. 
From the last time you saw your phone, was the battery getting low enough to shut down? Or was there enough battery charge in there to be able to still be running?
Lets go ahead and try to turn on your phone the normal way. Go ahead and hold the side ""power"" button on the right side of the phone for a few seconds and see if you see the phone start to power on. If this works, you should see the screen boot up with the white Apple logo.
If this does not work, we may need to do a ""force restart"" on your phone. Don't worry! Doing a ""force restart"" won't mess with any of the data that you may have stored on your phone. It's just a method of restarting your phone in the cases where errors like this happen. 
In order to get this ""force restart"" started, go ahead and hold the ""power"" button on the right side of the phone down as well as the ""volume down"" button that is on the left side of the phone. Hold both these buttons down at the same time for at least 10 seconds until you see the white Apple logo appear on the screen. 
If this does not work, the phone may not have enough charge to boot up and turn on. If this is the case, leave your phone charging for at least an hour and let it get charged up to a point where you can successfully turn it on or ""force restart"" it. 
Did I successfully help you will all your issues that you had today? If there is anything else you need assistance with, do not hesitate in getting in contact with us again!","Hello Timothy! My name is Andrew and I would be glad to assist you in adding an Outlook.com email to your new iPhone. Lets start out by verifying which version of iOS you are running before we go any further.
From the home screen, go ahead and click on the settings app (should look like an icon that has gears in the middle). Once in there, go ahead and scroll down to the ""General"" option (it will have a grey gear icon next to it). 
After you have clicked that option, go ahead and click in the ""About"" section.
About halfway down in that section, you should see a section called ""Version"". To the right of that section, it should tell you what version of iOS your iPhone is running. If you are indeed running the latest, then congrats! You have the latest and greatest. If not, I can show you how to update your phone to the latest update after we have taken care setting up your Outlook email.

Click in there and find the section that says ""Add account"" and click in there.
Once in there, find the Outlook.com logo, and click in there. 
After clicking in there, it will prompt you to enter in your login information for your email. 
After you have logged in, the phone may bring up a prompt telling you that the operating system will need certain permissions in order to enable you to use this account on the Mail app. This is all normal stuff, so don't worry about anything privacy related. 
After clicking yes to accept these permissions, it will take you to a screen in which the system will give you opportunity to choose apps that you want synced with your Outlook.com email. After choosing your preferred synced apps, go ahead and click on the ""Save"" option to save these settings. 
You can hit the home button after this, and then navigate to the ""Mail"" app on your phone and see if your Outlook.com emails populate within this app.

"Hi! I'm Ashton, and I'm going to help you change your ringtone to a specific contact on your Samsung Galaxy S8+.

From the Home screen, you'll want to swipe up on an empty spot to open your Apps tray. From there, find your Contacts app, and tap on it. Let me know once you've done that.

Great! Now, tap on the name of the desired contact, and tap ""Details"". In succession, tap EDIT, tap More, and then tap Ringtone. Let me know once you've gotten there.

Now, tap Allow Storage Permission, and tap ALLOW when that pops up.

Awesome. Once you've done that, you'll see a list of ringtones you can assign to your contact. Now you can tap any ringtone, tap OK, and it will be assigned. Tap the back button--it's in the upper-left hand corner--and your selection will be saved. Let me know how that goes.

Excellent! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Great. Thanks so much and have a wonderful day!","Hi Jamie, I'm Ashton. Sorry to hear about your iPhone 7. I'd be happy to help you get it turned back on.

Before we begin, one quick question: has your device been dropped, or suffered any other damage recently? Drops can cause screen issues like these at times.

Great; thanks for the info. If you haven't already tried it, press and hold the power button on the right side of the phone near the top for about 15 seconds. Let me know if that works.

That's alright, we've still got plenty of ways to sort this out. Now try pressing and holding that same power button, and press and hold the Volume Down button. Press these buttons together for about 15 seconds.

Great. Let's check on something. Do you have a way to test the charging cable? Sometimes, a bad usb cable or charging outlet can cause problems for devices.

Try plugging the cable into another device. If we get a charge, we know the cable is good.

Awesome. Now try plugging your test device and USB cable into a different outlet. It's possible power issues are creating the issue.

Now that we know the cable and outlet are both good, leave the device on the charger for about 20 minutes, then try both of the previous methods (power button, power button + volume down button) again. I'll keep this chat window open for when you get back.

Awesome! Glad to hear it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Great. Happy to help, and have a good one.
","Hi there, Timothy! I'm Ashton, and I'd be happy to help you set up your Outlook.com email on your iPhone. 

First, let's double check that iOS. Navigate to your Home screen and tap on Settings. It's a grey gear-looking icon.

Now, tap on General. It's another grey gear. Then, tap About.

Great! Several lines down on this page, there's a line that says ""Version."" Could you tell me what the number is on that line?

Thanks so much. You are indeed on iOS 11. Nice instincts. Now let's get down to business. Navigate back to the main page of the Settings app. You're already in the app, so tapping ""General"" in the upper-left hand corner, and then tapping ""Settings"", again in the upper-left hand corner, will do the trick.

Scroll down until you find ""Accounts and 1words"". Tap on it. Under accounts, tap ""Add Account"".

Excellent. Now Tap on ""Outlook.com"". You'll be prompted to enter your Outlook.com Username and 1word. Go ahead and do that. 

Now, the phone should inform you that ""iOS needs your permission to:"" followed by a list. Tap ""Yes"" under the list.

Awesome. You'll now be on a page with a variety of options for which parts of the Outlook app to synchronize with your phone, including Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes. To synchronize any one of these, tap the white circle on the right side of the screen that corresponds to the option. A background on the dot will turn green when confirmed.

Great! Now, just tap ""Save"" in the upper-right hand corner, and you're all set. 

If you ever want to make changes, head to the ""Accounts & 1words"" option within the Settings app again and tap on your Outlook.com email account to access its settings page.

Is there anything further I can assist you with?

Great. Happy to help and have a great day.
","I expect to do quite a bit of what I just practiced with: assisting with a variety of technical issues for a variety of people. I suspect that some of this work will involve relationship management. People never turn to Customer Support when they're having a good day, so I anticipate--and am prepared for--some frustrated customers. 
I like to help people; I've been doing this on my own for free for family members a long time as I'm technically inclined; and, as an added bonus for the gaps in my knowledge, I'm an extremely accomplished Googler. Much of my highschool years were spent breaking computers and trying to fix them before the owners found out, which made me, in the long run, more computer savvy, and more efficient at solving problems via quick internet searches. Anywhere Expert looks like the ideal opportunity for me to stretch my technical muscles and help others. 
This work fits with my relationship management skills, as well: I've been an RA, a video director, and I'm currently teaching students about film at a local studio--so I'm familiar with the strategies of channeling conversations in a positive direction. 
With my technical ability, flexibility in search, and relationship management skills, I believe this is an ideal fit for me moving forward.",1,1,1,87,3,1
"Hi Reggie! I’m Kassidy and I’ll be helping you with your Samsung Galaxy S8+ dilemma today. For your specific issue, I need to know if your phone has enough battery for this short process. If so, I will first need you to unlock your phone. 

Once on the home screen, you must tap on your contacts icon and select the particular contact. 
Then, tap “Edit”, followed by “More.”
After that is finished, I will need you to scroll to the “Ringtone” option. 
Next, tap to select your new ringtone for that contact, followed by the back key. 
Lastly, tap “Save” and the ringtone for that specific contact is now changed. 

Glad I was able to help you with this particular dilemma today, is there any other questions or concerns I can assist you with?","Hi Jamie! I’m Kassidy and I will be assisting you today. I have Apple products as well and I have had this issue specifically with my iPad Mini before. Chances are, your phone froze while black. Can I get a little bit more background information on your phone first? 
First, is your iPhone 7 software up to date? Usually if your iPhone software isn’t up to date it’ll glitch. For example, deleting things in your phone or freezing. 
Second, do you have access to a computer with the latest version of iTunes? If not, you might need one or need to install the most recent version iTunes in case the simple fixes I suggest don’t work. 

Whether or not your phone is updated, I will need you to press and hold both the power button located on the right side of your phone as well as the volume down button located on the right side of your phone simultaneously. Hold them both down for at least 10 seconds or until you see the Apple logo. 

If this is unsuccessful plug in your iPhone and let it charge for one hour. After a few minutes you should see the charging screen, which looks like a battery charging. If you don’t see that screen within an hour or you instead see the connect to power screen which looks like a battery charging with the iPhone plug with a lightning bolt below it, check the power jack, usb cable, and adapter. Make sure everything is correctly plugged in and not damaged. Apple chargers work best with their products as knock offs can sometimes be the cause of issues as well. If your device still does not turn on you will probably have to force restart your iPhone. This is also what you need to do if your device turns on but gets stuck while turning on. 

For these steps, I will need you to connect your device to the computer with the latest version of iTunes as mentioned earlier. To do this, plug the usb part of your cable to the usb compartment on your computer. Then, plus in the iPhone itself. While your device is connected, force restart the device. You do this on your specific iPhone by pressing and holding both the power button located on the right side of your phone as well as the volume down button located on the right side of your phone simultaneously until you see the recovery mode screen. The recovery screen looks like the charger and lightning bolt as mentioned earlier but instead of the battery it is an iTunes logo. On your computer you will get the option to restore or update your iPhone. Choose “Update.” iTunes will then try to reinstall iOS without erasing your data. iTunes will then download and update your software. This should fix your phone if all else 0s. 

I hoped I was successful in helping you resolve your iPhone 7 screen issue. Is there anything else you need help with today?","Hello Timothy, my name is Kassidy and I will be helping you set up Outlook on your iPhone today. First, I will need you to confirm that you have WiFi or some type of cellular service available on your phone. Next, I will need you to unlock your iPhone. Then, click on the “Settings” icon on your phone. It is grey and has gears on it. Once in the app, I will need you to scroll to the “Accounts and 1words” tab. From there, tap on “Add Account” and then tap on “Outlook.com”. I will then need you to log into yout Outlook account. You will then need to select the services you want from you email. For example, to sync your contacts, emails, calendars, etc. Lastly, tap the save button in the upper right hand corner and you’re all set!
Is there anything else you needed help with today?","I think I’ll be helping people with their cell phone issues, which people already come to me to do, except this way for everyone I help I will be getting a profit. I want to be an Anywhere Expert because I think the concept is convenient as well as smart. I like the fact that you can log in from anywhere and it is user friendly.

Is you phone currently still plugged into the charger?

We have two options that we can try to get your phone powered back on. Let's start with the first one!

We are going to try to reset your phone. This will not erase the data on your phone. To reset the phone, you will need to hold down the home and sleep/wake buttons - continue to hold the buttons down even after the slide to power off message appears. Did this help power your phone back on?

Our second option is to do a reset from your computer.

Turn the volume on your computer up. Plug your phone into the computer. Hold the sleep/wake and home buttons until you hear the sound of it disconnecting. Once you hear that sound, release the lock button, but continue to hold the power button (about 15 seconds or until it sounds like you've plugged something in). If done correctly, your devices screen will be black. And not wake. Much like how it sounds like it was before hand.

It will also open up an iTunes window saying that its in recovery mode. Restore it. It should only take 10-15 minutes max. Unless it has to download the firmware, in which case to 10-15 minutes plus however long the download will take.

If it takes longer then that, restart your computer, then try and restore again.

Did any of these steps help with restoring your screen back onto your iPhone?

Thank you for that information. If the iPhone is frozen and can't be restarted in the normal way do the following: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. If the red slider appears or the screen dims, keep pressing the two buttons until the Apple logo appears. 
 
A black screen is usually caused by a hardware problem with your iPhone, so there usually isn't a quick fix. ... On the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you perform a hard reset by pressing and holding the volume down button and the power button at the same time until the you see the Apple logo appear on the screen. 
 
Unless you are absolutely certain that there is plenty of charge left on the battery, connect the phone to a wall charger for at least 15 minutes. If it was just a low battery the phone will come on by itself. If it doesn't go to step 2. Hold the HOME and POWER (aka SLEEP) at the same time.

","A big perk of working for yourself, are the tax advantages not given to employees. You can write off equipment, supplies and even a portion of your home or car, if it is appropriate. Some of these expenses you currently have, but don't get a deduction for, such as Internet. Further, whereas in a job, you pay taxes on your total earning, in a home business, you can deduct your expenses first, and pay taxes on net income. With that said, it's important to learn about home business deductions to insure you're following proper tax laws. Ideally you should consult a tax expert.

","Hello, my name is Heather and I'll be glad to help see what is causing your iPhone 7 screen to shut off while charging. Here are a few steps to getting your phone working as good as new! 



1. Force Restart:
-Press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time.
-Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears). iOS devices with white faceplates will show a white launch screen. iOS devices with black faceplates will show a black launch screen.
When the launch screen appears, you can let go of the button combo.
-Once your iPhone or iPad has rebooted, check to see if it stays on and operational.

If this did not help, try the next steps-

2. Plug in:
-If your iPhone is rapidly discharging, plug it in. Once the charging cable's in place, you should see it begin to charge and you'll be able to read the battery level. If it shows little to no charge, it means something drained your battery. If it shows a partially or fully charged battery, you may have another problem.
-In either case, connect your iOS device to its charging cable, plug into an outlet or USB port, and start charging. Let it charge for an hour. If it doesn't seem to be responding, try a different charging cable, a different USB outlet plug, or a different USB port on your computer. Once you're fully charged, keep an eye on your iPhone and see if it shuts down again. 

I'm glad to have assisted you today! Are there any further issues you would like me to address today?","Hello, my name is Heather and I'd be thrilled to help you add your Outlook.com email to your new iPhone! The steps are quick and you'll be ready in no time!

I have lots of knowledge of such issues, but I am also very experienced with computer researching and capable of quickly finding solutions to issues I am not totally familiar with.  I have worked in Customer Service and Customer Relations for many years and am, therefore, very experienced.  I am proud of the skills I have and I always give 100%.  I understand that we need to be patient and good natured to be successful while working with important customers.  Each customer is important and deserves the proper attention and kindness.  I have recently resigned from my job of 15 years in order to hopefully work from home in order to avoid the long, stressful daily commute to and from the office.  My husband and I have owned two of our customer service companies ourselves.  One was a vending company that had equipment in over 200 locations.  This involved sales, customer service, handling of any problems and/or questions, billing, commissions, accounting, payroll, purchasing and managing 15 full time employees.  We sold this business and then purchased our current company, a swimming pool design/building/service company.  This, too, involves sales, customer service, communications and public relations.  I have assisted my husband with this business for the last several years while also working full-time in an insurance managing general agency. This entailed all communications and customer service with insurance agents for over 475 agencies.  I also was required to follow state of Texas & Texas Department of Insurance
compliance, appoint any new agents, maintain up-to-date
licenses & agency laser fiche files, handle customer service

"Hello, Reggie! My name is Sierra and I can definitely help you change your ring tone for a specific person.  
First you're going to want to click on your contacts button on your main screen.  It is an orange button with the outline of a person on it. 
After you've selected contacts you will want to find the person you would like to change the ringtone for. If you need help finding it I can guide you through that as well. 
Awesome! Now that you've selected the contact, you can go right ahead and click on that details button, which is the information sign, and select EDIT at the top of the screen. 
You will then select VIEW MORE which is right above the scan business card option. 
Scroll down and you will see ringtone. We are almost there! Once you select ringtone,  please select it and you will see the tones you can choose from. 
Does that answer all of your questions, or is there anything additional I can help you with today? 
I'm glad we could solve that problem for you! If there is any other questions please do not hesitate to ask! Have a great day, Reggie!
","Hello, Jamie. My name's Sierra and I will gladly help you with that.
To better assess the situation so I can help, was your battery low before you plugged it in?
If your battery was low I would definitely try leaving it plugged in for fifteen to thirty minutes to regain a charge. It may turn on automatically, or you can try holding the on/off button on the side of your Iphone to turn it on to reset. After approximately five seconds the phone will either turn on or you may see  the slider offering to turn it off.
Another step is to check the cable and make sure it isn't faulty. You can try to use another cable to connect and see if it turns on. 
If that solution doesn't turn on your phone, we can also try the hard reset on your phone. What you will do is hold down the on/off button like you did before and hold down the volume button at the same time. Continue holding for at least ten seconds. If the shut down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons. When the white apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let your phone turn start up. Did that work, Jamie?
If it didn't work no worries, there are a few extra steps we can take!
Now we will try putting your Iphone in DFU mode. First you will plug your Iphone into your computer. Once that's completed please let me know.
Awesome! Now try holding down the on/off button for 3 seconds then let it go. Once you've done that, hold down the on/off button and volume together for about 10 seconds. 
Release the on/off button but keep holding the volume down for about 5 seconds. If the screen is still black and nothing appears, you are in DFU mode. Follow the onscreen instructions in iTunes and let me know if you have any additional questions, Jamie!
I'm so happy to hear that it worked! If you have any additional questions please reach out. Have an amazing day!

"Hello Reggie, I am Shirley. Hope you are well. I see you want help with how to change the ringtone of a specific contact on your Galaxy s8+?

To Assign a Personal Ringtone
From the Home screen, touch Apps.
Touch Contacts.
Touch the desired contact.
Touch EDIT to edit the contact's information.
Scroll to and touch Ringtone.
Touch the preloaded ringtone you want to use and touch OK, or follow the instructions below to use a custom ringtone.

Ok, I know that's frustrating for sure. Let's see what I can do to help. 
Let's try a Force Restart
On your iPhone 7 or newer device, press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button at the same time. 
Keep holding down the button combo until you see an Apple logo appear on screen (your iPhone screen will go dark before the Apple logo appears).

"Hi Reggie, I'm Jason and I'd be happy to assist you in setting a custom ringtone for a contact. 

First off, from your phone's home screen there should be an icon to allow you to see all the apps currently installed. It looks like a three by three grid of gray dots, with the word ""Apps"" below it. Touching that will open your list of apps.

Once you are there, you can scroll to the icon for your contacts, which is usually an orange icon with the white silhouette of a head in the middle, labelled contacts. Touching this will open your phone's contact directory, showing you an alphabetical list of your saved numbers.

After you have opened your list of contacts you can scroll through the alphabetical list for the specific one you would like to change. Touch that contact to open the details currently saved for that contact, and scroll down until you see the word ""Ringtone"". It should be just after the entry for Groups. 

Touching the Ringtone entry will open Samsung's list of preloaded ringtones, and you can touch any one of those on the list and then touch ""Ok"" to save it to that contact.

If you have a custom sound or music you would like to use that is stored on your phone, you can scroll to the bottom of the ringtone list and touch ""add ringtone"". This will open up the sounds you have stored on your phone that it can find. You can select any of these from the list as the ringtone, touching the name to preview it, and touching the name again to pause it. 

Once you have selected the sound you would like, touch ""Done"" to add that file to your list of ringtones, then you should have the option to select it from the list as the custom ringtone for your contact. If you are happy with the selection, touch ""Ok"" to then save that custom sound as the personal ringtone for that contact. 

Is there anything else I can do to assist you today Reggie? If not I hope you have a great day, and feel free to get in touch again for any future assistance!","Hi Jamie! My name is Jason. I know it can be scary when your phone will not turn on. Let me assure you I will do everything I can to get you back up and running.

So first of all Jamie, lets make sure the charging cable is working properly. 

If you unplug your iphone and hold down the sleep/wake button, does a low battery picture show up on the phone? If so we might be dealing with a charging cable or power adapter that has quit working. If not we can skip the next few steps and try a different approach.

Can you take a close look at the cable to see if there are any sharp bends, or frayed parts? Sometimes the cables can wear out at the base of the plug that goes into the phone after a while. 

If you don't see any noticeable damage, perhaps try plugging the charger into a different outlet and waiting a few minutes. If there is no change let's take the charging cable and plug it into the USB port of your computer to make sure the wall charger isn't the problem. If there is still no activity on your phone we can proceed to the next step.

So if the charger and cable seem to be fine, then Jamie, what we will do is attempt to restart your phone. You need not worry though, it is a simple process that will not erase anything currently stored on your phone.

With your iphone 7 unplugged, I'd like you to hold down the Sleep/Wake button, and the Volume Down button until you see the apple logo appear on the screen. It usually takes about 10 seconds. Once you do you can let go of the buttons. Your phone should take a few moments to start up and hopefully you should be good to go!

If neither of these seem to be working we may need to attempt to restore your phone from a backup using iTunes. 

You can connect your iphone to your computer using your charging cable, and open iTunes. Then once you are in iTunes, click on the Device button at the top left of the window. Then click on ""Back Up Now"". It shouldn't take too long for iTunes to finish backing up your phone, and once it's done you can click on ""Restore iPhone..."" This process may take a little while so please be patient. Once this is completed you can disconnect your phone from iTunes and see if it will stay on for you.

Let me know if you have questions about any of the steps here Jamie, or if there's anything else I can assist you with today. If not I hope you have an awesome day, and please don't hesitate to reach out to us with any future concerns you may have!","Hi Timothy, my name is Jason. Congrats on the new phone, I hope you enjoy it! I'd be more than happy to help you in setting up your email account.

So to start out, lets touch the Settings app on your phone. It looks like a gray gear symbol.

Once you have opened your settings, touch the ""Mail, Contacts, Calendars"" option from the list.

In that menu you should see a list of accounts currently on your phone, including your iCloud account. At the bottom of this list you should see the option for ""Add Account.""

Your phone should then show you a list of the most popular e-mail services, and Outlook.com should be listed there. If you touch that, your phone should then ask you to put in your username and 1word for that account, and an option to give it a description. Make sure you don't share that information with anyone else, including me! :) 

If that information has been put in correctly your phone should connect to that account, and then ask you what parts of your account you want to sync with your phone, listing Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Reminders. Select all you wish to have delivered to your phone.

Once you are done, touch ""Save"" in the top right hand corner of the screen and you should be all set.

Now just to let you know Timothy, currently there is a known compatibility issue between the iOS 11 default mail app and Outlook.com. When trying to send messages through the default mail app, many users report getting an error that says ""Cannot send mail. The message was rejected by the server."" Both Apple and Microsoft have been made aware of the problem and are working on a fix which should be pushed out in a future update. 

Until then might I suggest downloading the Outlook for iOS app that is available for free on the App Store? If you touch the App Store icon, and search for ""Outlook for iOS"", it should give you the option to download and install the app on your phone.

Once it is installed, when you open the Outlook app for the first time it will prompt you to put in your username and 1word. Once that is done you should be able to access your outlook inbox and send and receive messages without any problem.

I hope this helps, Timothy, and if you have any other questions let me know! If not, have a great day!","As an Anywhere Expert I imagine I will be assisting people in understanding and utilizing the new and emerging technology in the best way possible. In this technological age things change and adapt at such a pace that it can sometimes be a struggle to keep up. Those of us who have a natural aptitude can do what we can to help others be sure that they are making the most of their tech. On the flip side, all this tech was made by humans, and ""pobody's nerfect"", so there's bound to be bugs from time to time. Finding solutions to those bugs can be daunting for even a seasoned veteran. As far as the nitty-gritty, I imagine I will be helping people set up new devices, fixing errors in existing devices, and adapting tech for specialized uses.

So I have a decent amount of experience resolving a wide variety of issues that could arise, and being able to determine the cause of the issue from people in a courteous and polite manner who are not always very tech savvy.

"Hi Reggie! My name is Miranda, and I am happy to help you change the ringtone of a specific contact on your Galaxy S8. Firstly, do you have your contacts saved to your Samsung or Google account? Users who save their contact information purely to their sim card have less options for customization per contact.
If you do not have them saved to your Samsung or Google account, you can easily transfer your contacts into your Google account. On the home screen of your Galaxy S8, swipe up to see all of your apps. Find your contacts. In there, you will see a menu icon, located in the top right-hand corner of your screen. In there, you will see an option to ""Manage Contacts."" There should be an option available that says ""Import/Export  contacts"" and in there, you should press ""Import"". From there, you should select your sim card, since that's where your contacts would be. A screen should show up listing all of your contacts. Select all the ones you want transfered, or you can easily choose all of them by selecting the ""All"" checkbox, located in the upper-left. Once you have chosen which contacts you want to go through, you have to choose where you want your contacts to go, and I would recommend Google. After you have done this, press import. Your contacts should now be safe in your Google account!
Now that you have your contacts backed up, you will have more options to customize each contact in your phone, including ringtones. Find and select the person you want to change the ringtone for under your contacts list. Press details, which looks like an info marker, and then press edit.  Press ""View more"", just above ""scan business card"". After that, scroll down until you see ""ringtone"". You will need to allow permission for your phone to use this feature the first time, but afterwards, it should bring up a list of ringtones you can set for that contact. You can repeat this process for any contact you want to customize.
Happy to help you through this process! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

","Hello Jamie. There are a few things that may help.

First, let your phone charge for 15 to 30 minutes and see if the screen comes on.

2. Restart iPhone
If charging the battery didn't turn your iPhone on, the next thing you should try is to restart the phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off.

If the phone was off, let it turn on. If it was on, restarting it by turning it off and then turning it back on is probably a good idea

If the restart doesn't work then try doing a hard reset.
Hold down the on/off button and Home button at the same time. (If you have the iPhone 7 series, hold down on/off and volume down.)

Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't)
If the shut-down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons

Are you sure that the charger that you were using is working properly and the socket is not faulty? I just wanted to ask those trouble shooting questions before getting started.

Ok, so it sounds like both the charger and the socket is working properly so lets move on to something else. Press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power key (sleep/wake button) together for 15 to 20 seconds.  If there's enough battery left to power the device on, the white Apple logo will appear. Did the apple logo appear?

Ok Great! release both keys and wait until the device reboots completely. Once your device reboots, you can resume charging it.

Did I help you resolve your issue today? Is there anything else that I can assist you with?

"Hello! I'm Stephen and I would be more than happy to help out with changing your ringtone for a specific contact on your S8+. 

To get started you will want to swipe up on the screen to bring up all of your apps. Once all of the apps have appeared you will need to find the ""Contacts"" app. It should look like an orange box with an outline of a person inside it. 

If you have any questions during this process please let me know!

Once the ""Contacts"" app has loaded you will want to find the specific contact you would like to edit. You can then select the contact by tapping on their name and it will open the details for that contact.

From there you can tap the edit button, then select ""More"" from the dropdown. Then you can select the ""Ringtone"" option and tap ""Allow"" to ""Allow Storage Permissions"". After this you will be able to select the desired ringtone for the specific contact and select ""Ok"" to confirm the selection. Once this is completed you can tap the back button in the upper left corner to return to the previous page and save the selection. Now whenever this contact calls you you will hear the unique ringtone you selected.

Does everything appear to be working correctly on your end? If there are any issues please let me know. Have I been able to help you with everything today? If there's anything else I can help out with please let me know!
","Hello Jamie! I'm Stephen and I would happy to help you get your iPhone 7 back to working order after shutting off while it was charging. 

This is something that shouldn't take much time and your phone should be back up and running in no time! Please let me know if you have any questions during this process. 

Before we get started, is it possible that the device has gotten wet or recently been damaged? 

While the iPhone 7 is plugged in you should be able to press and hold both the Lock and Volume Down buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo. This should make the phone reset and start up like normal. Sometimes it takes a little while longer than usual for it to completely come back up.

If this doesn’t fix the issue, you may want to try a different wall plug around the room. In some cases the current plug could be causes issues with the charger. If it was the plug then a red battery logo with a plug-in icon below it should appear. If that doesn’t happen it may be possible that the phone needs further inspection. 

Do you currently have insurance through your carrier for the phone? If you do you would be able to send that over to them and have it replaced. If that isn’t an option you can create a Genius Bar appointment with Apple to have them take a look at it. It’s possible that the battery may need to be replaced.

Have I been able to help you with all of your questions this evening? If there’s anything else I can help out with please let me know.   Thank you! Have a great night!","Hello Timothy, my name is Stephen and I would be happy to assist you with getting your Outlook.com email paired to your new iPhone. I hope you’re doing well today! How are you liking your new iPhone? Which device did you pick up? I just got the new iPhone X myself and I’m really enjoying it!

We should be able to get your email set up rather quickly so you can start receiving them as soon as possible. Are you interested in pulling contacts, calendars, and notes as well as your email?  Great! So, the first thing we will need to do is to unlock the phone and find the “Settings” app. It should look like a gray box with a gear shape in the middle of it. Once you tap on that it’s going to bring up the settings menu. You will need to slide down until you find the “Accounts & 1words” section and tap on it.

From there you should see a list of accounts that may include your iCloud account or other emails previously set up on the phone. Below those accounts you will see an “Add Account” button. After tapping on the “Add Account” button it will bring you to a screen with multiple email options. At the bottom above “Other” there should be an “Outlook.com” logo. Please tap on that option to bring up a login page for Outlook.com. Once you enter your login information it may prompt you to give permission to your iPhone to pull this information from Apple. After selecting “Yes” it will bring you to the final page to select what items you would like to pull to your device. This is where you would toggle your Calendar, Contacts, and Notes to be pulled from Outlook to your new iPhone. After you have toggled those options to “green” you can tap save in the top right to finish the setup. 

Now that this is completed we can test it out and make sure everything is working as intended. Please return to the home screen and find the Mail app. It will look like a blue square with an envelope in the middle. Once you tap the app it should open and pull in the mail from your Outlook account. If you have multiple email accounts setup you should be able to select the Outlook option from this page. If for some reason you aren’t seeing any mail or it’s giving you an error we can try the process again.

Wonderful! Is there anything else that I can help you out with today? I’d be happy to go over any other questions you have. 

I hope you have a great day!","Being an Anywhere Expert would give me the chance to help people learn and grow with their devices. I want to be able to be there for a customer when they need help troubleshooting an easy or difficult problem. For me, one of the greatest feelings is being able to help someone work through an issue they’re having with their technology. It’s always an rewarding experience to be able to walk through with someone how to fix their issue. A few years ago we bought my grandmother a tablet for her to read and browse the internet with. When she first got it she had no idea where to begin with using it, she didn’t know which buttons to tap, or how to unlock it at first. Since this was her first tablet, and first internet capable device, I took about a day to just sit down with her and teach her everything she might need to know about her new device. Nowadays she still calls me if something goes wrong with it but she loves her tablet and has used it almost every day. Having the ability to help her come from someone who has never used a tablet, to being able to navigate through it like a professional is why I would love to be an Anywhere Expert.

I believe that having the opportunity to be an Anywhere Expert would let me inform, teach, and help customers on their journey with their devices. It would give me a chance to make someone else’s life a little bit easier by taking the stress out of technical problems and make their day brighter. In a world of ever changing technology it’s nice to give someone an outlet they can count on when they need it most.",1,1,1,76,3,1

"Hello, my name is Stacie. I would be glad to help you change the ringtone of a specific contact on your Galaxy S8+. 

Here are the steps to change the ringtone for a specific contact.

Launch the Contacts app. This should be on your home screen.
Scroll until you find your favorite contact and tap on it;
Select Edit and tap on the MORE button;
In the extended menu, scroll to the bottom and tap on Ringtone;
Scroll again to tap on the “Add from device storage” option;

Select the special song for that special contact, from the Music Player app where you will be automatically redirected;

Let me know when you are finished.

Did it allow you to select a ringtone for the individual you had chosen?

Awesome! Did I answer your question?

Is there anything else I can do for you this evening?

Thank you so much! Have a great evening!
","Hello, my name is Stacie. I understand you can't get the screen to turn on and that this is a problem with your iPhone 7. I will gladly assist you in getting your phone working correctly. Use the following steps to reset your phone.

1. Hard Reset Your iPhone 

A hard reset forces your iPhone to turn off abruptly and turn back on immediately. It's kind of like turning a desktop computer off by pulling the cord out of the wall.
Even though it's not always a good idea to do, a hard reset is a go-to move for Apple technicians, especially when an iPhone is unresponsive. It's the iPhone equivalent of the tried and true repair method of “unplug it and plug it back in.”

Why Should I Hard Reset My iPhone?
A hard reset is usually a temporary solution to a software problem. It doesn't change anything at all — it just forces your iPhone to start from scratch, and often times the problem comes back.

How Do I Hard Reset My iPhone?
Press and hold the power button and the volume down button together until the screen goes blank and the Apple logo appears on the screen.
When the Apple logo reappears, let go of both buttons.
When your iPhone turns back on, the hard reset is complete.

Is everything going well for you? Do you have any questions at this point? Please read on and backup your phone so that you don't lose any information stored on the phone. What is the internal storage amount on your phone?

Did your screen turn back on?

That is awesome. Here are some tips on how to back up your iPhone 7.


Don't give up too soon if nothing happens! Hold both buttons down for at least 20 seconds before you give up. A few extra seconds here could save you a trip to the Apple Store.
You should only do a hard reset when absolutely necessary, because software corruption problems can occur when a hard reset occurs while the iPhone is doing something important, like saving a file.
In Apple jargon, the power button is also know as the Sleep / Wake button.
Make sure you're holding the volume down button — holding the volume up button won't hard reset your iPhone!

2. Back Up Your iPhone 

It's important to back up your iPhone before doing any major restores (such as a DFU restore). If something goes wrong while you're trying to fix your iPhone, having a back up means you won't lose any of your data (such as contacts, photos, apps, and more). Restoring from a back up is a lot more convenient than having to go and reenter all the information that was saved on your iPhone.

How Do I Back Up My iPhone?

There are two ways to back up your iPhone:

Backup Your iPhone Using iCloud
If you have a WiFi connection, you can back up your iPhone using iCloud.
Open the Settings app.
Tap iCloud (I blacked out my iCloud email address in my screenshot, but you'll see your iCloud email address there!)
 Tap Backup.
Make sure the switch next to iCloud Backup is on. You'll know the switch is on when the switch is green.
Tap Back Up Now.
A status bar will appear to tell you how much time is remaining.

Was your backup successful? 

Awesome! Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?

Thank you so much! Have a great night. If you need anything else, please let us know.


","Hello Timothy! My name is Stacie. I will be glad to help you add your outlook.com email to your new iPhone. 

In the new iOS 11, you can no longer find the ""Accounts"" option in the ""Mail"" settings, nor in ""Calendar"" or ""Contacts."" Instead, everything is found within a new settings menu called ""Accounts & 1words."" Apart from that small change, adding email accounts in iOS 11 is very straightforward, and you basically follow the same process of signing in and syncing your email addresses from iOS 10.

Don't Miss: 5 Mail Features You Need to Know About in iOS 11 for iPhone
To go over the process step by step, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Once inside, scroll down and select ""Accounts & 1words"" from the list of options. From there, tap on ""Add Account,"" and choose the email service you'd like to sign into.


After you've chosen your email service, simply follow the on-screen instructions in order to sign in with your email address and 1word. Depending on what service you choose, a permissions prompt might appear detailing various application permissions your email account will have access to, so tap on ""Yes"" to proceed.

You will now be taken to your account's settings page where you'll have the option to select which apps can access and sync with it, such as Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes. After choosing which apps you want to sync with your email account, tap on ""Save"" to finish up.

If you ever want to revisit your email account's app permission setting to make changes, you can edit your selection anytime by simply heading to ""Accounts & 1words"" option within the Settings app and tapping on your email account to access its settings page.

Was i able to assist you in adding your outlook.com email to your iPhone?

Awesome!

Is there anything else I can offer to assist you with this morning?

Thank you! Again, my name is Stacie. Have a wonderful day.
","I have always wanted to work from home. For Christmas, my oldest son bought me a new computer, desk, printer, etc. He is an adult and disabled. He doesn't need me to be at home, but he wants me to be at home. I have disabilities that make it difficult for me to stand for long hours. Being a Manager and Pharmacy Technician, I was always on my feet. I am interested in utilizing the home office he bought me.

My husband also works steady night turn and while working at my last job, I was never able to see him. I was not home so I couldn't put anything in the crock pot for dinner. I felt so bad leaving everything for him.

I have heard many wonderful things about Anywhere Expert. The company sounds like a perfect fit for me. I need flexibility and would love to travel. I haven't traveled since I was 13 years old. Needless to say, both of my sons are adults now and I am hoping to be able to work in a more relaxed atmosphere. My other son is in college. I was excited that he chose a college close to me. I am hoping to be able to spend more time with him.

Thank you for considering me for this position. I look forward to working with your company.",0,1,0,,1,0

Changing the ringtone on the galaxy s8+ should only take a few simple steps and I can walk you though the process. Do you have about 5 minutes to walk through them with me? Great, lets get started. Step1. From your Home Screen, select the ‘Contact List’ or ‘Phone’ application below the screen. By default it is on the bottom left portion of the screen. Step 2. Now the contacts are displayed, choose the contact for which you want to set a new ringtone. You can use the alphabetical navigation bar on the right side of the screen to make finding it easier. Did you find the specific contact? Perfect! we only have four more steps. Step 3. As the details of your contact opens, click on the ‘Options’ button and select ‘Edit’. This is located on the top of the screens right hand corner. How are we doing so far, Reggie? Sweet! Easy stuff huh? Step 4 Now you will be taken to the page where you can edit the information of your contact, from theirs name, number, address, etc… Scroll down and find the ‘Ringtone’ panel. You may have to click on the view more text towards the bottom of the options list. This is where the good stuff happens. Just bare with me and we will be rocking this ringtone! Step 5. Click on the ‘Default’ button. It will take you to the list of the possible ringtones. Three options appear on the menu that pops up:
	1. Default: If you want to use the profile ringtone only
	2. Ringtone: If you choose to set any of the pre-loaded ringtones on your phone.
	3. Go To My Files: Here you can use any of the music files that you have stored on the internal or memory card of your phone. Select the option according to the ringtone you want to use. I don't mind waiting while you make the selection. I like the fact they allow you to preview the sound. Step 6. Tap the ‘OK’ button for saving the changes. Step 7. Return to the home screen by pressing the ‘Home button’. 
Got to love technology! That was quick and quite painless don't you think?

Goodbye my friend.","Technology can be very frustrating and at times intimidating to new costumers. Most people are on the go and don't know where to get information so they ask for help. Dealing with this mix makes people feel vulnerable and all they need is an encouraging and understanding person to help. That's where being an Anywhere Expert can make a difference. We know where to find the right information at the right time.
	There are three general approaches that a technician can have when helping a customer troubleshoot computer issues. I like to look at these three ways by using the analogy of fishing, where the technician is the seasoned fisher and the customer is the one that needs fish to eat. The first approach “I am” or you don’t deserve fish, the second, “I can” or let me get you a fish, the third, “I teach” or let me teach you to fish. One of these approaches is best for troubleshooting the darker side of computers. Viewing each through the analogy of fishing will give an insight in to what approach to take and what approach not to take.
	The “I am” approach basically alienates the customer from the whole troubleshooting experience, by letting them know they could never figure it out for themselves. Some technicians want this because they do not have the soft skills to listen to what the customer needs. This approach has no room for soft skills and leaves everyone frustrated, even if the issue was resolved.
	The “I can” approach, or let me fish for you. Most technicians fall into this category when troubleshooting, because it is the quickest way to resolve the issue. Often times the customer only wants this approach because they do not have time to learn how to prevent this issue from happing again in the future. Again there is no room for soft skills because time is the issue, and professionalism takes time. These experiences happen over and over again, because the customer will not take the time to learn or the technician will not take the time to teach. Some call it job security when the customer has to call back later about the same issue.
	The “I teach” approach allows the customer to learn how to fish. A patient technician will listen to the customer explain the issue. While troubleshooting, the technician will involve the customer in the solution. Explaining what happened and why the issue occurred; the customer understands what to do the next time it happens. Soft skills are the tool that this technician uses in educating the customer. The issue is resolved the customer is satisfied, and if the customer has different issue they will call the teacher.

"Hello Reggie! My name is Felicia, and I would be happy to help you learn to set a ringtone for a specific contact. 

The first thing I need you to do is go into your contacts. Most of the time the contacts button is on the your home screen. It is an orange button that looks like an address book with the silhouette of a person on it.

When you select the contact, a gray bar will show up under their name. In that gray bar you will find a button titled ""details"". It is marked with a lowercase ""i"" with a circle around it. Do you see that icon?

Awesome! So once you go into the details page, you will see in the top right hand corner of the screen it says ""EDIT"". I will need you to touch that please. 

Once you get into the edit screen you will see where it says ""view more"" at the bottom in light gray. Click on that to open more options. Did you find the ""view more"" button?

Great! Now that more options are listed you will need to select the option titled ""ringtone"". This will give you a list of all of the ringtones that you have on your phone. It will also give you the option to add from device storage. At this point you will select the ringtone that you would like for that specific person. 

Once you have selected the ringtone, in the upper left corner you will see a blue arrow that looks like this ""<"". Touch that arrow to get back to the edit screen. 
Are you back at the edit screen?

Awesome. We are almost finished then! In the upper right hand corner you will see that it says ""save"". Can you select that for me please?

This will bring you back to the contacts information. Do you see in their information where it says ""ringtone"" and the name of the ringtone you selected?

I hope that this answers your question as I know how useful it can be to have a special ringtone for a desired person. If you have any further questions, please let me know. Have a wonderful day. ","Hello, I'm Leslie. I know that this can be really frustrating but let's try a few options to see if this will solve the problem.

Option 1. Restart iPhone
If charging the battery didn't turn your iPhone on, the next thing you should try is to restart the phone. To do this, hold down the on/off button at the top right corner or the right edge of the phone for a few seconds. If the phone is off, it should turn on. If it's on, you may see the slider offering to turn it off.
If the phone was off, let it turn on. If it was on, restarting it by turning it off and then turning it back on is probably a good idea.

Option 2. Hard Reset the iPhone
Try a hard reset if the standard restart didn't do the trick. A hard reset is like a restart that clears more of the device's memory (but not its storage. You won't lose data) for a more comprehensive reset. To perform a hard reset: 
Hold down the on/off button and volume down.
Continue holding them for at least 10 seconds (there's nothing wrong with holding for 20 or 30 seconds, but if nothing has happened by then, it probably won't)
If the shut-down slider appears on the screen, keep holding the buttons
When the white Apple logo appears, let go of the buttons and let the phone start up.

Option 3. Restore iPhone to Factory Settings
Sometimes your best bet is restoring your iPhone to its factory settings. This erases all the data and settings on your phone (hopefully you synced it recently and backed up your data), and can solve a lot of problems. Normally, you'd sync your iPhone and restore using iTunes, but if your iPhone won't turn on, try this:
Plug in the iPhone's USB cable to the Lightning/Dock Connector port, but not into your computer.
Hold down the iPhone's Volume button.
While holding the Volume button, plug the other end of the USB cable into your computer.
This will open iTunes, put the iPhone into recovery mode, and let you completely restore the iPhone.

Option 4. Put iPhone Into DFU Mode
In some situations, your iPhone may not turn on because it won't boot up. This can happen after jailbreaking or when you try to install an iOS update without enough battery life.
If you're facing this problem, put your phone into DFU mode this way:
Plug your iPhone into your computer.
Hold down the on/off button for 3 seconds, then let it go.
Hold down the on/off button and Volume button together for about 10 seconds.
Release the on/off button, but keep holding the Volume button for about 5 seconds.
If the screen stays black and nothing appears, you're in DFU Mode. Follow the onscreen instructions in iTunes.

Option 5. Reset Proximity Sensor
Another rare situation that causes your iPhone not to turn on is a malfunction in the proximity sensor that dims iPhone's screen when you hold it up to your face. This causes the screen to stay dark even when the phone is on and not near your face.
Hold down the Home and on/off buttons to restart the phone.
When it restarts, the screen should be working.
Tap the Settings app.
Tap General.
Tap Reset.
Tap Reset All Settings. This erases all your preferences and settings on the iPhone, but won't delete your data.

If none of this options have resulted in your iPhone turning on, then you will probably have to buy a new phone. Hopefully one of these solutions will result in your phone turning itself on. If you have any other question, please let us know. Have a wonderful day.","Hello. I'm Leslie and I would be happy to tell you how to add your Outlook.com email to your phone.

"Hi! I'm Aaron, and I can absolutely help you change the ringtone of a specific contact on your phone! How are you doing today?

Ahh, OK, let's get this done for you! Let's just make sure your phone is on and ready to go, let's also make sure we are on the home screen!

Great! So, now, touch on the apps icon. It's gray and should have some dots in it, and when you click on it all your apps should show up.

Awesome! Now, find the Contacts app. It should be orange with an icon of a person in the middle. 

OK, now touch the contact you want to set a specific ringtone for and once you see all their information click EDIT.

Excellent! Touch MORE, to see more specific settings for the contact. 

Cool, now when you swipe down you should see more precise information regarding the ringtone. By default, all contacts are set to a default ringtone provided by Samsung. To modify that, touch where it says ""Ringtone"".

OK, now you should see a long list of different ringtones. Each time you click on one of the sounds a preview is played to help make your decision. Continue swiping up or down to see more options and when you have selected your desired ringtone touch the back button in the top left hand corner. 

Great! Now, once you are back in the Contact information settings click ""Save"" which you should see at the top. Once you save the info, press the back key found on the bottom of your phone and you are done!

Now, each time you want to set another ringtone for another specific contact on this phone, follow the same process above, and make sure to hit Save each time! 

I am glad I was able to help out! Did I answer all of your questions today?

Thank you for chatting with us! Please do not hesitate to reach back out to us if you have any further questions.
","Hi! I'm Aaron and I will be more than glad to help you with that today! How are you doing today?

Ahh, yes, this does seem to be a problem. Let's get started. Is the phone plugged in right now and do you have any confirmation that it is charging?

OK, to see if the phone is charging, just press and hold on the power button until something pops up on the screen. 

Great! What do you see?

Awesome! This means that the phone is not charging. When you see a cable below the battery icon when the phone has shut down that means that the battery isn't receiving any power. But, you tell me that your cable is plugged in and should be charging the phone, right?

Weird. Let's make sure nothing is wrong with your cable, check to see if the power outlet actually works and see if the cable or the port is broken.

Yes! We did it. So, it was just that the cable had been bitten by your dog. Do you have another one?

Excellent! So, now when you plug that new cable back in, your phone will start charging and when you press and hold on the power button for some time, the Apple logo will appear. Let's try to keep those cables away from your dog, haha :p.

I have a dog too! The same thing happened to my cable once and I had to buy a new one, funniest thing ever!!!

Aww, what's  the name of your dog!

That's cute. Well, I'm so glad that I could help you today! Did I answer all of your questions?

Great! Let's scroll down and click on Accounts and 1words, its an option you will see with a gray key as an image next to it. 

Awesome! Go ahead an click on ""Add Account""!

Excellent! Now, tap on the email provider your going to use, it should be outlook.com!

OK! Enter your email address and 1word for the outlook.com email in the setup wizard. 

Yes, let's go ahead and tap Next.

Cool, now give it a second to process the information and your outlook.com email should already be in your phone. Your phone is going to ask you to sync notes, contacts, mail, and calendars, directly to your iPhone, that way, all your things will be in the same place. Choose the option you want and then click Save!

Awesome! In the future, everything you do on your outlook.com email or on your phone will be automatically synced with most of your information. 

I'm extremely glad I was able to help today, do you have any more questions?

OK, if you have another email you want to sync up, which you said was google, you would jump back into settings again, but instead of choosing outlook, you would choose google,.

Yes, you can also download another app from the app store to check your outlook.com email, you don't have to use the stock Apple one.

","Well, as an adult growing up in the tech world, it's very hard for most people to adapt to such strong changes in our day to day lives. Therefore, I think Anywhere Expert is the perfect solution! Personally, I would love to have a knowledgeable person that knows what they are doing help me out, but most of the time this is done in person, something a busy adult does not have to time to do. So, it's important that we use technology to help combat technological problems, and a chat is the perfect solution. I have become very familiar with technology ever since the first time I held a smartphone in my hand. I love the incredible things you can do, but yes, sometimes its the most confusing thing ever, and because most of Americans have a smartphone, they have to sometimes deal with confusing issues on their own. I have a group of friends that I have become their IT person. And it's really fun to help them out. Usually, one would think that stocking Apple websites and looking at Tech YouTube channels seems like a useless hobby, but I definitely see the potential in this. My love of technology is not just the knowledge, it's the ability to help others see more in their phone then just a screen with a bunch of code, no, having a piece of tech, such as a phone, is a relationship based off respect. And as always, technology finds a way to mess itself up, and we are here, as humans and creators of the tech, to help it. Some people can't, and some people, like the team of Experts can, and that's why I see myself as a potential candidate. Not just will I help others, I will make them grow and become more strong and less afraid of their product, because sometimes the helper needs a hero!",0,0,1,,1,0

"Hi Reggie! My name is Gary, I’ll be glad to help you with your issue today. I see that you need help setting up ringtones to specific contacts on your Galaxy S8 right?

The first thing you will need to do is open your contact list, you can do this by clicking on the dialer app which looks like a telephone.

Next you will click on where it says contacts, from there you will look for the contact that you want to change the ringtone of.

After doing that click on the edit icon which looks like a pencil next to the contacts name.

Once clicked a window will pop up and a list of all your ringtones on your phone will be shown. 

You will then choose from the list the ringtone of your choice for that specific contact.

I hope that I was able to help you with your problem, and if you ever need help again don’t be afraid to come back. Have a great day!","Hello Jamie! My name is Gary, and I’ll be helping you today. I see that you were charging your iPhone 7 and the screeen shut off and won't turn back on correct?

First thing first is we need to see if your phone is still getting a charge, so I’ll need you to unplug your phone from the charger. 

Once it is unplug try and turn it on using the power button which is on the top right side of your phone. If that doesn’t work I’ll need you to hold the power button again but also this time hold the home button which is the button at the bottom of your screen. 

Doing this will reset your phone so if your screen is ever frozen and you can’t shut down your phone this method is the best way of resetting your phone.

Now if that doesn’t work make sure that your charging dock which is the white block you plug into your wall socket is plugged in correct and the usb cable is also plugged and charge your phone.

Hopefully one of these methods have turned back on your phone and if it has turned back on I’d suggest taking it in and seeing if something is wrong with the battery or the screen because if your charging dock isn’t broken then something might be wrong on the inside of your phone.

But if your phone hasn’t come back on you will need to take it in and get checked cause I mention before it could be a problem with your battery or your screen and will need to be fixed in order for you to use it again.

Hopefully I was able to help you with your problem, and if you ever have any problems in the future feel free to contact us again. Have a great day!","Hi Timothy! My name is Gary and I’ll be helping you solve your issue today. I see that you’re trying to add your Outlook.com email to your iPhone correct. 

First I’ll need to know what kind of iPhone you have thanks. Second to check your iOS you will need to go to your settings app which is the gray app with the gear wheel in it.

Then from there you will scroll down till you see general  and it will have a gear wheel to the left of it. After that click on about and that will have the general information of your phone, if you scroll down you will see version and the first number will either be a 10 or 11 depending on the last time you update.

You will now go back by looking at the top left and pressing general then after that press settings it’s in the same area you just clicked on.

From here you will scroll down till you see accounts & 1words, it will have a key on the left side. Then you will see all your 1words if you have any stored on the phone this is where you can keep or delete your 1words for emails, websites or apps so you don’t have to keep putting them in. But you will look for where it says add account it’s at the bottom of any email accounts you have on your phone. 

Once that it is open you will see all the email services that you can add to the phone Outlook.com should be at the bottom of AOL.com above the word other. Then you will add in all your loggin information for your email account.

A hard reset forces your iPhone to turn off abruptly and turn back on immediately. It's kind of like turning a desktop computer off by pulling the cord out of the wall.

Even though it's not always a good idea to do, a hard reset is a go-to move for Apple technicians, especially when an iPhone is unresponsive. It's the iPhone equivalent of the tried and true repair method of “unplug it and plug it back in.”

Why Should I Hard Reset My iPhone?
A hard reset is usually a temporary solution to a software problem. It doesn't change anything at all — it just forces your iPhone to start from scratch, and often times the problem comes back.

Using the Mail app to log in and sync to email services such as Gmail and Outlook is incredibly easy to accomplish on the iPhone thanks to the intuitive nature of its operating system. This is still evident with iOS 11, and though the process differs slightly from its predecessors, it can still be accomplished with relative ease.

Adding a new email account in iOS 11 has slightly changed from iOS 10. In the older version, you would just go to ""Mail"" from the within the Settings app, then tap on ""Accounts"" to find the option to add a new email account. You could even add a new email account this way from the ""Calendar"" or ""Contacts"" setting.

In the new iOS 11, you can no longer find the ""Accounts"" option in the ""Mail"" settings, nor in ""Calendar"" or ""Contacts."" Instead, everything is found within a new settings menu called ""Accounts & 1words."" Apart from that small change, adding email accounts in iOS 11 is very straightforward, and you basically follow the same process of signing in and syncing your email addresses from iOS 10.

To go over the process step by step, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Once inside, scroll down and select ""Accounts & 1words"" from the list of options. From there, tap on ""Add Account,"" and choose the email service you'd like to sign into.

1.Press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power key (sleep/wake button) together for 15 to 20 seconds.
2.If there's enough battery left to power the device on, the white Apple logo will appear.
3.When this happens, release both keys and wait until the device reboots completely.
This is what you call Soft Reset. It’s hardwired in the phone so when the appropriate keys are pressed and held, the phone should restart. However, if it’s still not responding after that, then you need to do the next step.

Step 2: Make sure your iPhone 7 has sufficient battery to power up its components

Perhaps the reason why your phone turned off, won’t turn back on and respond to the soft reset method is because there’s not enough battery left. So, at this point, you need to plug your phone in to charge for at least 10 minutes. 

◦Physically check the cable for breakage
◦Look into the port on your charger for lint, debris or corrosion that may prevent charging
◦Try to check the pins to see if one of them is bent
◦Check the charging port of your phone for debris and corrosion
◦Try using a different charger


Step 3: Check for physical and liquid damage

As to the physical damage, you can actually tell if that’s the case because it will leave a dent or crack on the outside. The liquid damage, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated but if there was an instance that the phone got dipped in water and started acting crazy, then that might be it!
.

Step 4: Call Apple tech support or make an appointment with a tech

As far as troubleshooting is concerned, steps 1 to 3 are all you need to do or try. If the iPhone still won’t turn on after that, then it’s Apple technician’s job to fix the problem.","Hello, My name is Latoya and I'll be more than happy to help you with getting your Outlook email added to your new IPhone.

Great, next please tap the edit button.  Then you will scroll down to where it says view more.

","Hi Jamie, my name is Natasha.  I am so sorry to hear your screen has shut off while charging, I know how frustrating that can be.  I have had this happen to me as well and let me tell you I panicked!  I am glad to assist you with some trouble shooting.  I understand your screen will not come back on, what have you tried to get your screen back on?

Ok so the home button did not work to wake your phone back up.  You had mentioned your phone was on the charger when the screen shut off, do you know how much battery was left when you placed it on the charger and how long you have had it on the charger?

Thank you for that information Jamie! Lets try a couple of things together.  The first thing we should do is  try turning the phone on.  Since it has had 25 minutes to charge, lets try the power button (this is the small button on the right side of the phone.  Please press and hold this button for a few seconds, please let me know if either the apple screen or a red slider appears?

Thank you, since that did not wake your screen lets try a hard reset.  To do this please hold the volume down button (the bottom half of the button on the left side of the phone), and your home screen for 10 seconds.  We will know if this works because we will see the apple logo.  

Whew what a relief you got the apple logo!  Lets wait and make sure that the phone powers up completely and is working properly.  Just let me know once it powers up.

That is great news Jamie, I am so glad we were able to get your screen back on.  While we are here were there any other questions I may assist with?

Thank you!  Hope you have a great evening, don't hesitate to reach out to us in the future if there is anything we can help with!




","Hi Timothy!  I am Natasha and I will be happy to assist you with adding your outlook.com email to your new iPhone!  I am about due for a new phone myself, which iPhone did you decide on?

Wow that is exciting, I have heard nothing but great things about the iPhone X!  Before we get started, I would like to check exactly which iOS version your phone currently has.  Luckily there have been some updates apple has released since iOS 11 that will allow you to use your Outlook.com account on your new phone!  To get started please tap on your settings app (this app has a picture of a grey gear on it).  Once in settings please scroll down and tap on general (has the same grey gear next to it).

Great!  Now please tap on software update, this will either tell you your software is up to date and show you which version the phone is running, or it will let you know you have an available update.  Can you tell me which version your phone is running?

Perfect, your phone is already running the latest version 11.2.2 so lets get started on setting up your outlook account!  Before we do so may I ask is your phone a personal or business phone, and is the outlook we are setting up a personal or business account?  I only ask because business phones and accounts require special permissions.

Sounds good Timothy, lets get that personal outlook account added!  Since we are already in your settings, tap the general button in the top left corner of the software screen you are in, then hit the settings button in the top left corner of the next screen.  Just let me know once you get there!

Great!  Next please scroll down and tap on Accounts and 1words, followed by tapping Add Account.  

Perfect, thank you!  Now this is where you can select what type of account you are adding.  You will use this same process if you decide to add other email addresses as well.  Please select the outlook.com option, it should be at the bottom of the list.

OK great! The next couple of steps will require your personal information.  First you are going to enter the email address we are adding.  to do this click on the empty box, this will bring up your on screen keyboard.  Be sure to enter the complete email address.  Once you have entered your email address tap the next button, in the following screen you will enter the 1word for this account and hit sign in.  The next screen is going to let you know what permissions are needed in order to sync this account with your phone.  After reading through you will need to accept to move forward.  

Awesome!  Now the next screen is where you can choose which apps on your phone you want to sync with your Outlook account.  For example, you can allow your phone calendar to sync with your Outlook calendar, doing so will allow whatever you schedule in Outlook to show in your iPhone calendar.  To allow you tap the button to make it green, or tap it and leave it white if you do not want to allow it.  Once you decide which apps you want to sync then tap save.

Well done Timothy!  You will now be able to send and receive emails from your Outlook accounts.  To access these you tap on the mail app on your phone, which is the one with a white envelope!  Were there any other accounts you would like assistance with or any other questions I may assist with on your new phone?

Timothy, it has been my pleasure!  I hope you enjoy that new iPhone X and please remember we are here to help with any future questions you may have.  Hope you have a great day!




","As an Anywhere Expert I think I will be helping people with their tech related questions.  I think I will be expected to act as an expert and provide answers and support when people have questions they need answered quickly.  I think the difference with being an Anywhere Expert compared to some other help that is available is that an Anywhere Expert is more personable, and are Experts because they want to be and have a 1ion for what technology can provide its users.  This is why I want to be an Anywhere Expert.  Technology can be very frustrating if you are not familiar with it, and even more frustrating if you reach out for help and the person that is helping you does not seem interested or is not empathetic.  Having past experience with troubleshooting cellphones both in person and over the phone, I understand that everyone is at a different level when it comes to understanding different technologies, and that not everyone learns the same.  I believe that there is a way to make technology useful for all levels of understanding, it just takes the right people to teach!

"Hi Reggie! My name's Tabitha and I'd be more than happy to assist you in changing your ringtone for a specific contact on your device.

Customization options are always nice, so I'll jump right into helping you out!
First off all, you'll want to go to your Contacts app, which can be found by swiping up on your screen that allows you to pull up all your apps. The Contact app is orange and resembles the silhouette of a person.

Now that you're in your contacts, you'll want to find the contact whose ringtone you want to personalize and then select it. From there, tap on the edit option and then the MORE button. 

Awesome! I'm glad I've been able to help you make it this far! The MORE button allows you to view an extended menu screen, and from here you can choose the Ringtone option at the bottom of the list. Are you wanting to use the pre-downloaded ringtones that came with the device, or would you like to use a song from Sound Picker?

(Pre-downloaded option choice)
Great! With that being said, you should already be in the Ringtone menu, where you can scroll through the songs, listen to them, and decide if there's anything you'd like to use! Just press the song you'd like, and you're all set!

(Sound Picker option choice)
Totally understandable! Sometimes I prefer my own music styles over the ringtones given as well! With that being said, you'll want to scroll all the way down and tap on ""Add from device storage"" from the current screen that you're on. Select, in the new, popup window, then app you want to use for that action – make sure you select Sound Picker. 

Choose the song you want; Hit done if you want the highlighted part of the mp3 song, which is a default option; or uncheck the box of the Highlights Only option and then hit the Done button if you want it to play the mp3 song from the very beginning.

I'm sorry to hear about that; I know how much of an inconvenience this can be.

Let's allow the phone to charge for a few minutes and could you tell me if you see the charging screen with the battery on it?

It's not appearing? No problem! In this case, we're going to have to force restart your device. Don't worry, the content on your device won't be deleted.

In order to force restart your iPhone 7, you're going to want to press and hold both the Side button (on the right of your device), and both the volume buttons (on the left of your device) at the same time for about 10 seconds until you see the Apple Logo.

"Hello there! I'm Marky, and I'd be happy to help with your ringtone request for your Galaxy s8+. 
From your home screen, find the 'Phone' app, a green app that has a phone in the middle of it. From there, switch over from the default 'Recents' tab, over to the 'Contacts' tab. Select the specific contact for which you'd like to change the ringtone for, and then select the 'Details' button in the upper right corner. From there, click the 'Edit' button, then scroll down till right above the 'Scan Business Card' button and click 'View More'. Scroll down until you see the 'Ringtone' field, and edit the ringtone to your desired one. 
Have all of your concerns been addressed here today? 
Don't be afraid to reach back out to us. Have a great day!","Good evening! I'm Marky and would love to help bring your iPhone 7 back to life. 
Was your phone succiently charged before it shut itself off on the charger?
There are multiple ways to try and troubleshoot this issue, and I'll try my best to see if any of them will work for you.
First is a soft reset. This works by pressing and holding down the volume down button on the left side of the phone, and the power button on the right side of the phone for 15 to 20 seconds. If there is enough battery, a white screen with the Apple logo will appear, and when that happens, you can release the buttons and wait for your device to reboot.
If this doesn't work, and you've been charging your device for quite a while, there's a possibility your charger has gone bad or been damaged in some way. I recommend you check your charger just in case that is the issue.
You can also restore your device to factory settings, this deletes all of your devices memory and I do not recommend this method unless you've backed up your device recently.
Plug USB cable into dock port on your iPhone but not the computer,  hold down the volume down button, while holding the volume down, plug other end of the USB cable into the computer. This should open iTunes, put your phone into recovery mode and let you completely restore youe phone from scratch.

Has this helped your concerns for the day, and are there anymore questions you have for me? Feel free to reach out to us at anytime! Have an amazing day!","Hello there! I'm Marky, and I'm happy to help you with your IOS 11 email request.

To add an email with IOS 11, you first need to go to the 'Settings' app, a gray app with a gear in the middle. From there, you'll scroll down until you see 'Accounts and 1words', which has a white key next to it on a gray background. Once inside the 'Accounts and 1words' screen, you'll want to select 'Add Account', then you will choose the email probider you'd like to use, which in your case is Outlook.com.
Once you select which service you'd like to use, there are instructions to follow to sign into your account, and possibly permissions to agree to depending on the service you selected to be able to proceed. After signing into your account, you'll by taken to Outlook's settings page to pick which apps can and cannot sync to Outlook, and then select 'Save' when youre completely finished.

Firstly, please open up the ""Contacts"" application (it is a orange icon with a white graphic depicting a person) located in your app drawer (the button that has 6 or 9 dots in a square) and select the contact that you would like to change the ringtone for.

At the top of the Contacts application there is an Edit button that has a pencil on the left hand side of it, can you please click that for me?

","Hello Jamie, I'm Ron! I'll be happy to help you try to get your iPhone 7 back up and running.

Firstly, is your device hot to the touch if you hold it in your hand?

If the screen is black, and pressing the power button or home button doesn’t wake the device, it may just be powered down.  In this scenario, all you need to do is press and hold the power button on the device until you see an Apple logo, and at this point, the device should start to boot back up. Let me know if this works for you.

If a soft reboot doesn’t work, try a hard reboot. To perform a hard reboot, you can press and hold both the Home button and power button at the same time for 10 seconds, or until you see an Apple logo appear on the screen. Can you try this for me please?

You won't lose any of your data or personalizations by doing this. Press and hold the power button on the right side of your phone.

There are two ways to do this. The first way is to download the Outlook app and login using your Outlook.com e-mail and 1word.

If you have alias e-mail accounts, this is the best way to be able to use them also. If you'd prefer to use the iPhone native Mail account, here's how to do so. Open your 'Settings' app (the gray gear wheel) and scroll down to 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars' and select it. Click on 'Add Account' then tap on 'Outlook.com.' You will receive a prompt to enter your e-mail address and 1word for the e-mail account you would like to add. You may also enter a nickname for the account. Enter the information and click 'Next' in the upper right screen.

"Hi my name is Nnagozie and I’m happy to assist you in changing the ringtone today. Let’s start by Opening the Contacts app which could be located in the settings of your phone. Find the contact you wish to modify. Click the small circled ""i Details"" button. At the top of the next screen, click the Edit button. In the edit screen, scroll down near the bottom, right above the SCAN BUSINESS CARD button, and click on the View More option. Scroll down, and you will see the Ringtone field. Edit that to which ever contact you want to assign a new ringtone to and you're good.","I am sorry to hear that your screen on your iPhone 7 shut off while charging and won’t come back on. That could be frustrating . My name is Nnagozie and I’ll do all I can to resolve your iPhone 7 issue today . Let’s start by pressing the POWER button on your iPhone which is located on the right hand side of the iPhone frame and if nothing happens then this could be resolved easily. Either your battery has run down, or iOS has ""crashed"" and needs to be rebooted. On rare occasion the firmware has been corrupted, but let's save that for last. The following steps will usually get your phone working again in a few seconds:
 
Unless you are absolutely certain that there is plenty of charge left on the battery, connect the phone to a wall charger for at least 15 minutes. If it was just a low battery the phone will come on by itself. If it doesn't go to step 2.
Hold the HOME button which is located at the below the LCD screen which looks  just like a circle and POWER at the same time. An Apple logo should appear in 10 - 20 seconds. Relase both buttons, wait about a minute, and your phone should be back to normal.
Occasionally it may be necessary to toggle the Mute switch which can be located on the left hand side of the iPhone frame a couple of times before Step 2. No one is sure why, but sometimes it helps if just holding the 2 buttons doesn't work.
 
If absolutely nothing happens after step 3. either your phone is broken, your cable is defective, or your charger has 0ed. Try different chargers and cables to isolate the problem. Or take all of them to an Apple store for diagnosis.
 
If you get an error message, or you see a picture of a USB plug and iTunes, you will need to restore your phone with iTunes. Is there anything else I could assist with you today ? You have a wonderful evening .","If I may understand correctly , you have a new iPhone but don’t know how to add your outlook.com email. I’ll be more than happy to assist you today.

First, let's try resetting your phone.  Don't worry, this won't harm any of your data on the phone.  To start, hold down the power button and the volume down button on your phone at the same time.  Keep holding them down until the Apple logo appears.  Once the Apple logo appears, you can release the buttons while the phone finishes restarting.  Did that work?  Great!  I'm glad that I was able to help.  Please note that your phone will ask for your 1code or 1word after a restart and will not let you use Touch ID until that code is entered.  That is completely normal.  Were there any other matters with which I could assist you today?  Sounds good.

It will then open the Outlook.com sign-in page.  Are you there?  OK.  Next, enter your email address and click Next.  Then, enter your 1word and click Sign in.  You may be prompted to give iOS permission to access certain features of your Outlook.com account.  This is normal.  Select Yes to give the necessary permission.  Next, it will ask you which items from Outlook.com you would like to sync with your phone (Mail, Contacts, Calendars, etc.).  Slide the switches to the right (in the green) for the items you'd like to sync and then click Save.  You can now exit Settings by clicking your home button to get back to your home screen.

","Hello Jamie! My name is Jessica! I would be happy to help you resolve your black screen issue! Do you have time to work this issue out now? Great! Lets get started! 

A black screen on an iPhone 7 could be a few different things. One issue could be that it may be experiencing a software crash, which causes the screen of your iPhone 7 to turn black and become unresponsive. If that's the case, then the problem isn't that your iPhone 7 isn't turning on — it's that your iPhone 7 has been on the whole time! When your iPhone 7 is on but not responsive, it looks almost identical to an iPhone 7 that is turned off.

Before we dive in though, we should make sure the problem isn't just the display of your iPhone 7. Do you have a computer with iTunes at hand? Awesome! You will want to begin by plugging your iPhone into your computer using your charging cable (also known as the Lightning cable). If your iPhone 7 is recognized in iTunes, I recommend that you back up your iPhone up immediately. If you were able to connect your iPhone 7 to iTunes and back it up, or if you can hear your iPhone 7 making any noises, you might need to get your displayed repaired. Was your phone recognized by iTunes and do you hear any noises coming from your iPhone? Okay! Since it did not connect that means we need to do a Hard Reset. Are you ready? Great! First you want to hold down both the VOLUME DOWN button and the Home button at the same time and hold for 10 seconds or until you see the Apple logo appear on your screen. Let go as soon as you see the logo appear. When it turns back on the Hard Reset is finished. 

Was your problem resolved Jamie? That's great! Was there anything else I could help you with today? Okay! Thank you so much for using Anywhere Expert. Please do not hesitate to contact us for any further questions or issues. Have a great day Jamie!","Hi Timothy! My name is Jessica.

Hopefully this will help it turn on. Before anything, make sure to backup all your data just in case this happens again. I would suggest taking your phone to the Apple Store if this problem is persistent. Hopefully this fixed your phone and I answered all your questions. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are here to help! Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day. ","Hello!

I would absolutely love to be an Anywhere Expert because I simply enjoy helping people resolve tech problems with their computers or phones. Working out of my home would be a huge bonus as well.  This job really can’t be called a job or work to me because I derive great pleasure and satisfaction when I can figure out the resolution to a problem. It’s just plain fun to me! I’m the kind of person that doesn’t give up or stop trying to find a solution. I actually will feel a bit uncomfortable until I resolve the problem.  I have a very analytical mind and I love a challengeI I frequently go to my 90 year old mom’s house or jump on the phone with her to help her with simple issues she has with her laptop and she always tells me I’m amazing and can’t believe how I can fix her problem so quickly. She usually spends hours trying to figure it out herself before she gives up and calls me for help. And after I tell her the problem is fixed, the look of shocked relief on her face is priceless! Like she can’t get over how I was able to figure out and fix her problem so fast because it’s all so complex to her. She thinks I’m a genius! Haha! It makes me so happy to make someone’s day go from bad to good once their problem is resolved. I’m no genius, but if I don’t know the answer to a question or how to instantly fix something, I’m very resourceful and good at navigating and researching issues.

Reggie: I saved a song to my Ringtones that I want to use.

Reggie: I think that's everything.

Me: Thank you for chatting with us, and I hope that you have a wonderful rest of your day!

To summarize, my response would depend on what kind of ringtone the customer specifies. In my response, I make sure to greet the customer and make them feel comfortable. After helping the customer with their initial concern, I make sure to ask if there's anything else they need help with. I end the conversation on a positive note, hoping to give the customer a positive experience so they will return.","I would first respond by introducing myself and asking the customer questions to gain a better understanding of the situation. I've provided and example chat below:

Me: Hi Jamie! I'm Kate and I would be happy to help you turn on your iPhone 7. That must be super troubling.

Customer: Yeah it really is

Me: Before your screen shut off, was your phone charger working?

Customer: Yeah I checked to make sure it wasn't the charger

Me: Ok, thanks for the info. Have you dropped your iPhone or exposed it to any type of liquid recently?

Customer: No, not at all

Me: Ok, let's try to force restart your device - go ahead and hold both the Side and Volume Down buttons for about 10 seconds. The apple logo should appear.

At this point, the customer should see the apple logo and her phone should turn back on. I would end the chat by asking her if she needs help with anything else. However, if her phone still hasn't turned on, I'd continue the chat similar to the example I've provided below:

Customer: I don't see an apple logo

Me: Do you have another USB cable and power adapter that you can try?

Customer: Yes. I tried that but it didn't work either

Me: This may be a software malfunction, so we'll use iTunes to recover your phone and re-install iOS. Do you have your computer available?

Customer: Yes I have it right here

Me: Ok great! Go ahead and connect your phone to your computer and open iTunes. Let me know when you're there.

Customer: I'm there

Me: Awesome. Hold down the Power and Volume Down buttons at the same time. Don't release them until you see the Recovery Mode screen. 

Customer: Ok I see the recovery screen. It says Restore or Update

Me: Go ahead and select Update - this will allow iTunes to reinstall iOS without erasing any data. It should only take about 15 minutes.

Customer: Yeah it's downloading

Me: Great! Let me know when it's finished. 

Customer: Alright it's done and working

Me: That's great news!

Customer: Yes thank you so much

Me: You're welcome. Does this resolve all of your concerns today?

Customer: Yes, definitely

Me: Thank you for chatting with us. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!

This scenario poses a potentially complicated problem. If her iPhone still hadn't turned on after attempting to reinstall iOS, we'd have to try another approach that would erase all of her data. I wanted to try and resolve the issue without the customer having to re-download everything. And again, I made sure to end the chat on a positive note, ensuring customer satisfaction.","Like the previous chat examples, I would begin this conversation by introducing myself and asking questions to help the customer out as best as I can. I've provided a sample chat below:

Me: Hi Timothy! I'm Kate and I would be happy to help you add your Outlook email to your new phone. Which iPhone did you get?

Customer: The iPhone X

Me: Nice! Are you wanting to use the Outlook app or the mail tab provided through your iPhone?

Customer: Just the mail tab

Me: Ok I can definitely help with that. Go ahead and unlock your iPhone and tap the Settings icon. Let me know when you're there.

Customer: I'm there

Me: Great! Scroll down and select Accounts & 1words, then tap Add Account. It should give you a list of email services.

Customer: Ok done

Me: Awesome. Select Outlook.com and follow the on-screen instructions to sign in with your email address and 1word.

Rarely can take longer but usually no more than an hour.  Usually, if you have it plugged into your computers USB port, it will take a lot longer.  If anything try soft reset after having the phone on the charger for 20 minutes

BY AMBOY MANALO

 09/18/2017 3:02 PM

Using the Mail app to log in and sync to email services such as Gmail and Outlook is incredibly easy to accomplish on the iPhone thanks to the intuitive nature of its operating system. This is still evident with iOS 11, and though the process differs slightly from its predecessors, it can still be accomplished with relative ease.

Adding a new email account in iOS 11 has slightly changed from iOS 10. In the older version, you would just go to ""Mail"" from the within the Settings app, then tap on ""Accounts"" to find the option to add a new email account. You could even add a new email account this way from the ""Calendar"" or ""Contacts"" setting.

In the new iOS 11, you can no longer find the ""Accounts"" option in the ""Mail"" settings, nor in ""Calendar"" or ""Contacts."" Instead, everything is found within a new settings menu called ""Accounts & 1words."" Apart from that small change, adding email accounts in iOS 11 is very straightforward, and you basically follow the same process of signing in and syncing your email addresses from iOS 10.

Don't Miss: 5 Mail Features You Need to Know About in iOS 11 for iPhone

To go over the process step by step, open the Settings app on your iPhone. Once inside, scroll down and select ""Accounts & 1words"" from the list of options. From there, tap on ""Add Account,"" and choose the email service you'd t like to sign into.
After you've chosen your email service, simply follow the on-screen instructions in order to sign in with your email address and 1word. Depending on what service you choose, a permissions prompt might appear detailing various application permissions your email account will have access to, so tap on ""Yes"" to proceed.

You will now be taken to your account's settings page where you'll have the option to select which apps can access and sync with it, such as Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes. After choosing which apps you want to sync with your email account, tap on ""Save"" to finish up.",I will be helping customers troubleshoot their phones.
